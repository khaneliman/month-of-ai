    "After quitting dating apps, a woman meets the supposedly perfect man and accepts his invitation to a romantic weekend getaway, only to find that her new paramour has been hiding some unusual appetites.",
    "FRESH follows Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones), who meets the alluring Steve (Sebastian Stan) at a grocery store and - given her frustration with dating apps - takes a chance and gives him her number. After their first date, Noa is smitten and accepts Steve's invitation to a romantic weekend getaway, only to find that her new paramour has been hiding some unusual appetites.",
    "Fed up with looking for companionship in all the wrong places, disillusioned Noa is done with the dating scene. Then, after an endless series of awful first dates with deluded losers, handsome stranger Steve's magnetic personality catches Noa by surprise. And just like that, Noa decides to give hope a second chance. After all, a loveless life is a life without meaning. But now that she is back in the game, with a sudden surge of potent endorphins flooding her body, Noa must face love's greatest torture: the mysterious, vague uncertainty creeping up on her. Is her Prince Charming too good to be true? If Noa based her choice on the moment, has she bitten off more than she can chew?—Nick Riganas"
