Then, a faint trail of clues sends the intrepid adventurer to cold Austria, where he encounters the statuesque archaeologist Dr Elsa Schneider.

  "synopsis": "Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) is the father of Henry \"Indiana\" Jones Jr.\nAs an archaeologist, Henry's passion for antiquities has passed on down to his son, who is a Boy Scout in 1912. On a scout expedition in Utah mountains Indy finds a group of thieves stealing national treasure (The Cross of Coronado which dates back to the 1520) from an ancient cave. Indy believes that National treasures belong in a museum.\nIndy steals a priceless artifact & runs on a horse. He is pursued by the thieves as he gets on a train. As it turns out, the train was transferring animals for a circus.\nHe falls in a tub of snakes (fear of snakes), fights inside a lion cage (with a whip). He gets home when the sheriff arrives with the thieves & forces Indy to return the artifact (which the thieves say that Indy has stolen from them). The thief chief puts a Fedora hat on Indy.In 1938, Indy is shown to fight the man who bought the Cross of Coronado, on a ship, and retrieve the Cross as Indy still believes that it belongs in a museum.\nIn 1938, Indy is at Uni when he gets a brown paper package from Venice, which he puts in his pocket. Indy hands over the Cross to Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott).\nIndy is picked up by 3 men who take him to Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a generous patron to the museum. Donovan is apparently an oil magnate whose drilling team has uncovered fragment of a stone marker dating to the 12th century in Ankara. The marker speaks of the Holy Grail, the chalice that Jesus used during the last supper, and the cup that held his blood after the Crucifixion. The cup was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea. It was then lost for 1000 years, before 3 Knights of the First Crusade found it. 2 of the brothers walked out of a desert 150 years after the Grail was found. They walked back to France, but only one of them made it. Before dying, he told his tale to a Franciscan Friar. The Knight told the Friar that 2 markers had been left behind that together would reveal the location of the Grail.\nThere were 2 markers kept in 2 separate locations. Joining the 2 markers will create a whole tablet, which will reveal the location of the Holy grail.\nDonovan says that his project leader (Henry Jones Sr.), who found the 2nd marker with the Grail location has vanished. Henry had determined the 2nd marker to be in the tomb of the 2nd brother, in Venice, Italy.\nDonovan says that Henry's assistant is Doctor Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who informed Donovan of Henry's disappearance.The package from Venice is Henry's diary with every known info about the Grail. In Venice Indy meets Schneider & uses the last clue left by Henry to find the 2nd marker. Indy takes an impression of the 2nd marker on a piece of a paper, which already had the impression from the first marker.\nThe tunnels where the marker lies is drenched in oil & is set on fire by a cult determined to prevent discovery of grail. Kazim (Kevork Malikyan) is the leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, the cult which is dedicated to protecting the Grail.Indy escapes with Schneider & is pursued by cult. He captures Kazim to learn Henry is in the castle of Brunwald in Germany. Kazim says that his cult is prepared to go to any lengths to keep the Grail safe.
