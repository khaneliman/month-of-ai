    "When the CIA's most skilled operative, whose true identity is known to none, accidentally uncovers dark agency secrets, a psychopathic former colleague puts a bounty on his head, setting off a global manhunt by international assassins.",
    "Six, a highly-skilled assassin in the deep-cover Sierra program of the CIA, is the agency's best merchant of death. However, a mission goes bad and now Six is on the run from the CIA with sociopathic former agent Lloyd Hansen hot on his trail. Aided by agent Dani Miranda and handler Donald Fitzroy, Six must be his most ruthless to avoid Hansen, who will stop at nothing to bring him down.—Diane",
    "Six is part of the CIA's Sierra program, a program whereby non-agents are recruited to fulfill certain missions on an off-the-books contract basis. In completing one such contract he discovers that the man he killed was a fellow Sierra member, Four. Four was killed because he had incriminating information on Carmichael, a senior CIA operative. Now Six has that information and Carmichael will do anything to get it.—grantss"

  "synopsis": "The film begins in 2003 in a prison. A convicted murderer, Court Gentry, (Ryan Gosling) is visited by Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton), a CIA recruiter. After going over Gentry's files and background, Fitzroy offers him a job working for the Sierra Program.18 years later in Bangkok, Gentry is now employed by the CIA as an assassin under the code-name \"Sierra Six\". He is tasked with taking out a target referred to as \"Dining Cart\" (Callan Mulvey). Aiding him is fellow assassin Dani Miranda (Ana De Armas), while superiors Denny Carmichael (Rege-Jean Page) and Suzanne Brewer (Jessica Henwick) keep eyes on him. Before Six can take out the target, he holds back when a child shows up. Six goes off the plan and goes after Dining Cart when the fireworks outside go off. He and Miranda take out Dining Cart's goons before Six goes after the man himself. After a fight, Six fatally stabs him, but Dining Cart reveals in his dying breaths that he is Sierra Four, and Carmichael sent Six to kill one of his own guys. Four gives Six a necklace with a chip containing information that can bring Carmichael and his cronies down.Carmichael contacts Six after, and he denies recovering anything off of Four. Six then switches clothes with a civilian before logging onto a computer to try and see what is on the chip, but he is lacking a code to log in. Six then contacts Fitzroy, who is in Baku, to inform him that he thinks Carmichael is a bad guy. Fitzroy says he will do what he can to look into it.Carmichael suspects Six knows the truth about him, so he employs the help of a former CIA agent, Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), to get to Six first before his deeds are exposed, even though Brewer is against it because Hansen is a known sociopath. Carmichael calls Hansen, who is in Monaco torturing a man with electric cables. Hansen is more than happy to go after Six. He finds Fitzroy at a funeral and questions him about Six, but gets no answers. Hansen resorts to having Fitzroy's niece Claire (Julia Butters) be kidnapped as leverage.Six is being escorted by an extraction team in Chiang Mai, when Fitzroy contacts the leader and tells him to quietly take Six out. However, Six is one step ahead of them and begins to fight and kill off the team before causing the plane to blow up and crash. He contacts Fitzroy, who tells him that Hansen has Claire.A flashback shows two years earlier in London, where Six and Fitzroy met with Sierra handler Margaret Cahill (Alfre Woodard).
