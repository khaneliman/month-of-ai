    "John McClane and a young hacker join forces to take down master cyber-terrorist Thomas Gabriel in Washington D.C.",
    "When someone hacks into the computers at the FBI's Cyber Crime Division; the Director decides to round up all the hackers who could have done this. When he's told that because it's the 4th of July most of their agents are not around so they might have trouble getting people to get the hackers. So he instructs them to get local PD'S to take care of it. And one of the cops they ask is John McClane who is tasked with bringing a hacker named Farrell to the FBI. But as soon as he gets there someone starts shooting at them. McClane manages to get them out but they're still being pursued. And it's just when McClane arrives in Washington that the whole system breaks down and chaos ensues.—rcs0411@yahoo.com",
    "12 years after after John McClane stopped Simon Gruber, he's back with a problem which is going to be more difficult and personal than ever before. An organization of Internet-based terrorist led by Thomas Gabriel. They are taking control of everything in America from their computers and slowly taking over the country. Accompanied by Matthew Farrell, one of the hackers who accidentally assisted the villains in setting up the system, McClane must both find Gabriel and help prevent him from taking over America completely. Gabriel knows McClane's on his way, and will make it as personal as possible, which means involving McClane's daughter, Lucy.—Film_Fan",

But as New York City police detective John McClane delivers old-school justice to a new breed of terrorist when a massive computer attack hacker on the U.S. infrastructure threatens to shut down the entire country over Independence Day weekend.—ahmetkozan"
  ],
  "synopsis": "Responding to a brief computer outage at its Cyber-Security Division by tracking down top computer hackers (who are turning up dead one by one), the FBI (led by Miguel Bowman (Cliff Curtis), Deputy Director of the FBI Cyber Security Division) asks NYPD detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) (since they are short staffed due to the holiday weekend) to bring in hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) to question him on how their systems were hacked. McClane arrives at Farrell's residence just in time to save Farrell from assassins sent by Mai Linh (Maggie Q), who works for Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant).\nMcClane has been having trouble with his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who tells her dates that her dad is dead.Gabriel sends a chopper for his 3 remaining assassins and asks them to follow Farrell and eliminate him. Gabriel is operating out of a mobile truck with his team and asks Trey (Jonathan Sadowski) to track down Farrell.\nOn the way to D.C., Farrell tells McClane that he had written an algorithm for Linh that could crack a specific security system for white hat purposes. Meanwhile, Gabriel (a former Defense Department analyst who leads a group of Cyber-terrorists systematically shutting down the entire U.S. infrastructure) orders his crew of hackers to take over transportation grids (starting in Washington DC) (triggers anthrax and fire alarms over all government buildings) and the stock market, while nationally broadcasting a threatening message (made by stitching together words from speeches of past US presidents) to the U.S. government.McClane and Farrell are stuck in the resulting traffic jam and walk over the rest of the way to the FBI building.\nFarrell recognizes this as the start of a \"fire sale\", a cyber-attack designed to disable the nation's infrastructure. Bowman dismisses Farrell's concerns, but McClane knows that he was attacked by professionals. and whatever Farrell did is connected to whatever is going on. He presses Bowman who agrees to debrief him. McClane and Farrell are driven to FBI headquarters (Farrell's voice is broadcast over the radio when the driver switches on the police radio (Farrell was talking to McClane in the back seat) and is picked up by Trey and used to find his location), when Linh (posing as a dispatcher) reroutes the convoy into an ambush. Farrell recognizes Linh's voice and McClane asks her to put her boss, Gabriel on the phone. Gabriel offers McClane a ton of money to shoot Farrell and walk away, but he declines.McClane fends off the attackers, destroying their helicopter. McClane drives into a tunnel (Gabriel opens up traffic from both ends, causing a mother of a pile-up) and then after dropping Farrell off, drives the car into the copter by leveraging height from a divider ramp.\nThinking McClane and Farrell are dead, Gabriel starts stage 3 and sends a team to secure the Woodlawn site.After McClane pleads for his help, Farrell guesses that Gabriel's next target is the power grid (since power grids are run on closed networks, they cannot be shut down remotely and have to be shut down physically on-site. They find the location of the hub of the Eastern sector. Farrell teaches McClane how to get a car remotely started when you don't have a key), and he and McClane drive to a utility super-station in West Virginia. They find a team led by Linh taking over the super-station. McClane and Farrell kill the team, and Linh falls to her death following a struggle with McClane. Enraged over Linh's death (since he and Linh were lovers), Gabriel redirects large amounts of natural gas to the utility super-station in an attempt to kill McClane and Farrell, although they are able to escape.\nMcClane is able to video chat Gabriel over Linh's phone and gets a pic that he sends to Bowman. As the lights go out, Lucy gets trapped in a lift.McClane and Farrell then travel by helicopter to the home of hacker Frederick \"Warlock\" Kaludis (Kevin Smith). Warlock identifies the piece of code Farrell wrote for Linh as a means to access data at a Social Security Administration building at Woodlawn, Maryland. Warlock tells them that Gabriel was a top security expert for the U.S. Department of Defense. Gabriel attempted to alert the Department to weaknesses that made America's network infrastructure vulnerable to Cyber warfare, but his unorthodox methods led to his dismissal. Warlock runs a trace route and identifies Gabriel's location at Woodlawn (during a power outage, that location is drawing in massive amounts of power. Plus, the code that Farrell wrote is used to disable security only deployed at Woodlawn).\nGabriel taps into their connection and reveals that he has located McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, whom he kidnaps. It is revealed to Bowman that the Woodlawn building is actually an NSA facility intended to back up the nation's personal and financial records in the event of a cyber-attack, which was designed by Gabriel himself. The attack on the FBI prompted a download of financial data to Woodlawn which Gabriel hopes to steal.McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility; Farrell discovers one of Gabriel's men downloading financial information and manages to encrypt the data before he is captured. Gabriel then takes Farrell and Lucy with him in his mobile rig, as his team flees. McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking the semi-mobile base (Gabriel, Lucy and Farrell are in a van up front). Gabriel accesses the communication system of a United States Marine Corps Aviation F-35B Lightning II and orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving. The jet is destroyed by falling debris and McClane survives and sees Gabriel's vehicle pull into a nearby hangar. There, Gabriel demands that Farrell remove the encryption from the financial data; when Farrell refuses, Gabriel shoots him in the knee and threatens to kill Lucy. McClane arrives and kills two of Gabriel's henchmen but is himself shot in the shoulder by Gabriel's last henchman Emerson (Edoardo Costa).Gabriel positions himself behind McClane, putting the barrel of the gun in his shoulder wound. McClane then pulls the trigger. The bullet travels through McClane's shoulder and hits Gabriel in the chest, killing him. Farrell grabs a handgun and kills Emerson. Afterwards, McClane thanks Farrell for saving Lucy's life.",
