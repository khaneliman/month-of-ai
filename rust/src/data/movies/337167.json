    "Newlyweds Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) are forced to cut their honeymoon short and return home after receiving news of a break-in at Christian's corporate headquarters. Some computer files were stolen and security camera tapes identify the perpetrator as Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), Ana's former boss who was fired for sexual assault. Meanwhile, Ana is introduced to her new personal security team. Christian surprises Ana with a new house and has hired an attractive architect, Gia Matteo (Arielle Kebbel), to rebuild it. Ana is annoyed when Gia openly flirts with Christian in Ana's presence. Ana privately threatens to fire Gia if she continues her flirting, forcing her to stop."

  "synopsis": "The film opens on the wedding day of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) with all their friends and family in attendance. After the reception, Christian takes Ana straight to their honeymoon by flying on his private jet to visit Europe, where they naturally consummate. Christian remains protective of Ana when they are at the beach and she is sunbathing topless, concerned that other men will try to make a move on her. Christian takes her back to their room, where more kinky sex ensues.Back at Grey Enterprises, a man is seen going to the company's data center to plant a bomb. Christian's assistant contacts him and informs him that there was a minor fire but nothing serious. After the couple watches security footage, Ana identifies the suspect as Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), presumably seeking revenge after Ana and Christian got him fired after he tried to assault Ana.Upon returning home, Christian hires two bodyguards, Sawyer (Brant Daugherty) and Prescott (Kirsten Alter), to stay by Ana's side wherever she goes. He also hires an assistant, Mrs. Jones (Fay Masterson), to help around the house, but Ana says she wants to cook Christian dinner. During their dinner, Ana makes a joke about being pregnant, which appears to make Christian uncomfortable. She asks if he does want kids, and he says maybe someday.Ana returns to work at SIP where she is promoted to the senior editor position, though she feels that people will think she only got it thanks to Christian. He visits Ana while she meets with a writer, Boyce Fox (Tyler Hoechlin), with the implication that he is jealous, and he is also upset that Ana still uses her maiden name at work and not Grey.Christian takes Ana to a house he bought away from the city for the two of them. They meet with the architect, Gia Matteo (Arielle Kebbel), who comes off as very flirty with Christian. Ana notices and very assertively tells Gia to back off and to pick a new design for the house.\nOn their way back to the city, Christian's bodyguard Taylor (Max Martini) informs him that someone is following them. Ana drives the car into the city and manages to evade the driver. They pull over somewhere and begin to have sex. Ana thrusts Christian very vigorously as he climaxes with no condom on.Later, they review surveillance pictures of the driver, which appears to be a woman and not Jack. Christian orders his people to dig up everything they can on Jack. Afterwards, Ana offers to cut Christian's hair. When she goes to find scissors in his desk, she finds a gun in there. Christian tells her it belonged to Leila Williams (the woman that stalked them), and he didn't turn it in to the police because he didn't want Leila to get into more trouble than she was already in.Ana goes out for a drink with Kate (Eloise Mumford), despite Christian wanting her home soon. Kate mentions that Elliot (Luke Grimes) said that police found a number of files on Jack's computer of the Grey family, which Christian never told Ana. Before going home, Ana notices she has six missed calls from Christian, but Sawyer told him where Ana was. When she gets home, Jack appears in her room and holds a knife to her throat, attempting to kidnap her. Sawyer and Prescott intervene and take Jack down before the police arrive.After the incident, Christian is distant from Ana, as he felt he couldn't protect her because he didn't know where she was. He brings her into his pleasure room for some BDSM but he only teases her as a means of punishing her for breaking their trust. Christian says he was fearful because he dreamed that Ana was dead and that he blamed himself for not being able to help her.To reconcile, Christian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen with Kate, Elliot, Mia (Rita Ora), and Jose (Victor Rasuk). Upon arriving at their house, Christian plays the piano and starts to sing, which Elliot and Mia say they have never heard him do. Although they are enjoying their vacation, Ana has a nightmare that Jack has found her. She goes to eat ice cream in the kitchen before Christian goes to find her.
