Newly-promoted maverick USNavy Commander Joe Glass is promoted captain of the Virginia-class submarine USS Arkansas, finds the truth and rescues the Russian captain, legendary admiral Andropov, with other survivors, who helps them overcome the hostile Russian vessels. Meanwhile Russian president Nikolai Zakarin, who was visiting the Moermansk base on Kola peninsula, has been taken hostage by his war-hungry minister of defense Dmitriy Durov. To avoid a nuclear war, Lieutenant Bill Beaman's SEAL commando, already parachuted -with a bad fall- to spy on the base, is ordered to rescue Zakarin, and Glass to pick them up, neither proving nearly easy, even if sensible Andropov cooperates sincerely.—KGF Vissers"

  "synopsis": "A U.S. submarine, the USS Tampa Bay, vanishes while shadowing a Russian Akula-class submarine in the Arctic. Rear Admiral John Fisk (Common) sends a Virginia-class submarine, the USS Arkansas, under the command of newly-promoted and unorthodox Commander Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) to investigate.Jayne Norquist (Linda Cardellini), National Security Agency senior analyst, analyzes this incident with the upcoming meeting of Russin Defence minister with Russin President Zakarin. She senses something is wrong with the timing of the attack on the US sub and recommends putting eyes and ears on the ground where the meeting is taking place.At the same time, a Navy SEAL team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens) is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base, but their mission is swiftly complicated when Martinelli (Zane Holtz), the team's new DM recruit, is rendered unconscious during the HALO drop. When they arrive at the naval base, they witness defense minister Dmitri Durov (Mikhail Gorevoy) conducting a coup and taking Russian President Zakarin (Alexander Diachenko) prisoner, and swiftly realize that Durov intends to trigger a war.Meanwhile, the Arkansas discovers the lost U.S. submarine (due to a torpedo attack), and also finds a sunken Russian submarine damaged in a manner that suggests internal sabotage rather than external attack. They are attacked by another Russian submarine that has been hiding under an iceberg, but Glass is able to destroy the ambush person and rescue Russian survivors from the wreck, including submarine captain Sergei Andropov (Michael Nyqvist).Back at base, the U.S. government learns about the coup. Admiral Charles Donnegan (Gary Oldman) recommends preparing for war, while Fisk (under advisement from Jayne that US is dealing with only a rouge general and the entire Russian military and hence deploying the fleet might play into Durov's hand by forcing a war) suggests that the Arkansas be sent to rendezvous with Beaman's team after they have rescued Zakarin. Glass manages to convince the reluctant Andropov to help, and with Andropov's knowledge of the minefield around the base, Glass navigates the Arkansas near the base undetected. Meanwhile, Beaman's team infiltrate the base and succeed in retrieving President Zakarin, but lose two teammates in the process. He delivers the injured president to the Arkansas's DSRV, then goes back alone for Martinelli, whom he was forced to leave behind due to prior injuries.As U.S. and Russian fleets face off for battle, the Arkansas sustains further damage when they are attacked by Andropov's old ship - a heavily armed destroyer now commanded by Sutrev (Ilia Volok), a member of Durov's conspiracy - but Andropov is able to communicate a message affirming that President Zakarin is aboard the submarine. When Durov orders his forces at the base to fire missiles at the surfaced Arkansas, Glass refuses to take action, recognizing that firing back at the Russians could start the war he is trying to stop. In the last seconds, Andropov's old crew-mates defy orders and destroy the incoming missiles with CIWS before they can strike the Arkansas, and subsequently destroy Durov's naval base headquarters with their missiles. With the war averted, Glass docks the Arkansas to the Russian naval base to return Zakarin and Andropov's surviving crew to their country. Glass and Andropov bid farewell and confirm their respect for each other. Beaman returns with an injured Martinelli, and the Arkansas crew travels to the U.S.",
