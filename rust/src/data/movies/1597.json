    "Male nurse Greg Focker meets his girlfriend's parents before proposing, but her suspicious father is every date's worst nightmare.",
    "Madly in love with charming schoolteacher Pam, Greg Focker, an unambitious Chicago nurse and chronic underachiever, wants to make a good impression on her father, Jack, more than anything. And, in the following 48 hours, against the backdrop of a hectic weekend at her parents' house, Greg will have to put his skills to good use and, hopefully, charm his way out of trouble. However, there is one tiny detail: Jack has a knack for uncovering the truth, and Greg has been quite economical with it. Under those circumstances, will he ever get Jack's approval? Above all, is love blind?—Nick Riganas",
    "A Jewish male nurse plans to ask his live-in girl friend to marry him. However, he learns that her strict father expects to be asked for his daughter's hand before she can accept. Thus begins the visit from Hell as the two travel to meet Mom and Dad, who turns out to be former CIA with a lie detector in the basement. Coincidentally, a sister also has announced her wedding to a young doctor. Of course everything that can go wrong, does, including the disappearance of Dad's beloved Himalayan cat, Jinxie.—John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net>",
    "Male nurse Greg Focker is poised to propose to his girlfriend Pam during a weekend stay at her parents' home. But here's the catch . . . he needs to ask her father first. Alas, the fur flies as Jack Byrnes, Pam's cat-crazy, ex-CIA father takes an immediate dislike to her less-than-truthful beau. Greg's quest for approval gets seriously sidetracked as Murphy's Law takes over and a string of mishaps turns him into a master of disaster and total pariah in the eyes of the entire family . . . all except for his shell-shocked girlfriend, who can't believe she still loves her one-man wrecking crew.—Official DVD cover"
