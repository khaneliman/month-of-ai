    "The Lamberts must go deeper into The Further than ever before to put their demons to rest once and for all.",
    "Ten years ago, Josh and Dalton Lambert are hypnotized to forget their astral voyage to the Further. On the present days, Josh has divorced Renai Lambert and is estranged from his son. During the funeral of his mother Lorraine Lambert, Renai suggests Josh to drive Dalton to the university to reconnect with him during the journey. However, when they arrive at the dormitory, they have an argument and Josh returns home. Dalton is an Arts student and his Professor Armagan asks her students to go deeper in their inner fears and Dalton discovers a red door. Soon he is haunted by demons from the Further.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"
