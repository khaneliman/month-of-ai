Then there are those who call it home — Crooked cops, sexy dames, desperate vigilantes. Some are seeking revenge, others lust after redemption, and then there are those hoping for a little of both. A universe of unlikely and reluctant heroes still trying to do the right thing in a city that refuses to care.",

    "An exploration of the dark and miserable Basin City and three of its residents, all of whom are caught up in violent corruption.",
    "Four tales of crime adapted from Frank Miller's popular comics, focusing around a muscular brute who's looking for the person responsible for the death of his beloved Goldie (Jaime King), a man fed up with Sin City's corrupt law enforcement who takes the law into his own hands after a horrible mistake, a cop who risks his life to protect a girl from a deformed pedophile and a hitman looking to make a little cash.—Tom Benton",
    "Pivoting around four stories from Frank Miller's Sin City universe, three tainted anti-heroes of Basin City, the cradle of crime and corruption, cross paths in their search of redemption. On the brink of retirement, Detective John Hartigan, the vile city's last honest cop, breaks every rule in the book in his crusade to save the innocent eleven-year-old girl, Nancy Callahan, from the clutches of the well-connected child molester, Roark Junior. Meanwhile, in another part of the town, bearing the deep scars of endless fights, Marv, the hulking ex-convict and grotesque brute with the killer fists, finds himself framed for a crime he didn't commit, hell-bent on revenge and murder. Finally, as a bloody act of justice in the Old Town, the city's red-light district, threatens the already delicate truce between the local prostitute community and the police, the taciturn private eye, Dwight McCarthy, becomes a protector after helping their cause. Can there be justice without sin?—Nick Riganas",
    "Walk down the right back alley in Sin City, and you can find anything. This lousy town is as black-and-white as the men and women living in it, and they're all the same: true to themselves until the grimy hands of the law try to corrupt their upstanding ways. Leaping from the pages of Frank Miller's comic books, Sin City is film noir like you've never seen it before.—Johnny",
    "\"Sin City\" is infested with criminals, crooked cops and sexy dames, some searching for vengeance, some for redemption and others, both. This movie incorporates storylines from three of Miller's graphic novels including \"Sin City\", which launched the long-running, critically acclaimed series, as well as \"That Yellow Bastard\" and \"The Big Fat Kill\". Where Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a bum ticker and a vow to protect stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba). Marv (Mickey Rourke), the outcast misanthrope, is on a mission to avenge the death of his one true love, Goldie). There's also Dwight (Clive Owen), the clandestine love of Shellie (Brittany Murphy), who spends his nights defending Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Towne girls from Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro), a dirty cop with a penchant for violence.—Austin4577@aol.com"

  "synopsis": "The Customer Is Always Right (Part 1)\nThe Salesman (Josh Hartnett) walks onto a penthouse balcony where The Customer (Marley Shelton) looks out over Basin City. He offers her a cigarette and says that she looks like someone who is tired of running and that he will save her. The two share a kiss and he shoots her; she dies in his arms. He says he'll never know what she was running from but that he'll cash her check in the morning.That Yellow Bastard (Part 1)\nOn the docks of Sin City, aging police officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) tries to stop serial child-killer Roark Junior (Nick Stahl) from sexually assaulting and killing eleven-year-old Nancy Callahan (Makenzie Vega).
