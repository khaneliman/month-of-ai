  "synopsis": "James Bond (George Lazenby)-agent 007-saves a woman on the beach from committing suicide by drowning, and later meets her again in a casino. The woman, Contessa Teresa \"Tracy\" Di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg), invites Bond to her hotel room to thank him, but when Bond arrives he is attacked by an unidentified man. After subduing the man, Bond returns to his own room and finds Tracy there, who claims she did not know the attacker was there. The next morning, Bond is kidnapped by several men, including the one he fought, who take him to meet Marc-Ange Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti), the head of the European crime syndicate Unione Corse.Draco reveals that Tracy is his only daughter and tells Bond of her troubled past (she was the only child, and Draco had to send her away to Switzerland after her mother died, for education as he was always pursued by the police. without supervision, she became rebellious and began doing things just to spite Draco), offering Bond one million pounds if he will marry her (he wants Tracy to have a home that he himself could never provide). Bond refuses, but agrees to continue romancing Tracy if Draco reveals the whereabouts of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas), the head of SPECTRE, whom Bond has not been able to find in 2 yrs. .Bond returns to London, and after a brief argument with M (Bernard Lee) at the British Secret Service headquarters (M is cross with Bond for wasting 2 yrs in trying to chase down Blofeld), where Bond tries to resign (instead Moneypenny changes his request to 2 weeks of leave, which M grants), heads for Draco's birthday party in Portugal.\nThere, Bond and Tracy begin a whirlwind romance (Tracy was pissed with Draco and made Draco give the link to Blofled to Bond, so that Bond only came to her for her, and not for the information), and Draco directs the agent to a law firm in Bern, Switzerland. Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold (James Bree), and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms genealogist Sir Hilary Bray (George Baker), attempting to claim the title 'Count Balthazar De Bleuchamp'.\nMiss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), M's secretary.Posing as Bray (after letting the real Bray know that this is a matter of national importance), Bond goes to meet Blofeld, who has established a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. Bond meets 12 young women, the \"Angels of Death\", who are patients at the institute's clinic, apparently cured of their allergies. The girls hit on Bond en-mass and one of them \"Ruby\" writes her room number on his thigh, underneath the tables.\nRuby Bartlett (Angela Scoular), an English girl at the clinic suffering from an allergy to chickens, whom Bond seduces. Nancy (Catherina Von Schell), a Hungarian girl at the clinic whom Bond also beds. Scandinavian girl (Julie Ege). Chinese girl (Mona Chong). Jamaican girl (Sylvana Henriques). American girl (Dani Sheridan). English girl (Joanna Lumley). Indian girl (Zara). Australian girl (Anouska Hempel). German girl (Ingrit Back). Israeli girl (Helena Ronee). Irish girl (Jenny Hanley).\nAt night Bond goes to the room of one patient, Ruby, to seduce her. At midnight Bond sees that the 12 ladies go into a sleep-induced hypnotic state while Blofeld gives them audio instructions for when they return home. In fact, the women are being brainwashed to distribute bacteriological warfare agents throughout the world.\nPiz Gloria is built on top of a mountain with no access roads of any kind. The only way in and out is a rope-way, which is heavily guarded..Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland (into Germany, on pretext of confirming some facts about his past) so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by his loyalist Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppat) when he visits Ruby's room again the following night. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his henchmen to take the agent away and lock him in the machinery room for the rope-way. Bond eventually makes his escape from the rope-way room and enters the main room of the Piz Gloria. Bond find that Blofeld had hypnotized the 12 girls and had handed them a vanity case each. The case had a communicator and a bottle of the engineered virus which he would tell the girls when to use and how..\nAs the girls board the rope-way to be sent back home, Bond skis down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase. Arriving at the village of Lauterbrunnen, Bond finds Tracy purely by chance, and they escape Bunt and her men after a car chase (going through a car rally competition as well).\nA blizzard forces them to a remote barn, where Bond professes his love to Tracy and proposes marriage to her, which she happily accepts. The next morning, as the chase continues, Blofeld sets off an avalanche; Tracy is captured, while Bond is buried but manages to escape.Back in London at M's office, Bond is informed that Blofeld intends to hold the world at ransom by threatening to destroy its agriculture using his brainwashed women, demanding amnesty for all past crimes, and that he be recognized as the current Count De Bleuchamp. M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission for Tracy. Bond then enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch and injures his neck.Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal, then drive away in Bond's Aston Martin. When Bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed by a head-shot in the attack. Bond cries while cradling her lifeless body.",
