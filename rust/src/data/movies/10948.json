    "A fox named Tod and a hound named Copper vow to be best friends forever. But as Copper grows into a hunting dog, their unlikely friendship faces the ultimate test.",
    "When a fox named Tod and a hound named Copper become inseparable friends as babies, their friendship grows stronger every day. But as they grow up, they grow farther and farther apart, to the day when their bond is put to the ultimate test.",
    "A fox named Tod quickly becomes friends with a hound named Copper and they are instantly growing close with each other. Unfortunate for them, they are on opposite sides of the fence with Tod living with a kindly widowed farmer and Copper living with an unscrupulous hunter who wants to train him to become a hunting dog. As time passes, their relationship is put to the test when Copper's owner sets out to shoot Tod for almost killing his other dog, Chief. With that, there are consequences ahead.—Blazer346",
    "A wise owl and two henchmen birds see that orphaned fox cub Tod is 'found', adopted and 'raised' by childless human widow Tweed as a happy semi-wild pet in a rural backwater. He even makes friends with canine pup Copper, the apprentice of tweed's grumpy farmer neighbor Amos Slade's hunting dog Chief, who is kept in the dark. As they grow up, Amos takes Copper a season on hunting training, from which he returns as a routine prey killer. After a biter row with Amos, Tweed feels obliged to release Tod in the wild. There he is the prime prize for vindictive Amos and Chief's next great hunt, but both juveniles remember their friendship, leaving Copper with mixed loyalties and Tod challenged to act fox-smart.—KGF Vissers",
    "A young fox named Tod is taken in by an old woman after his mother is killed by a hunter. Full of mischief, Young Tod befriends Copper, a hound dog pup. As they grow up, however, their friendship becomes endangered by what they have become; Copper is a hunting dog, and Tod is his prey.—Amy L. Plack <trek@wpi.edu>"
