Hundreds of years old, the vampires are finding that beyond sunlight catastrophes, hitting the main artery, and not being able to get a sense of their wardrobe without a reflection-modern society has them struggling with the mundane like paying rent, keeping up with the chore wheel, trying to get into nightclubs, and overcoming flatmate conflicts.—Production",
    "Wellington, New Zealand. Four nocturnal flatmates and best friends for all eternity--Lord Byron wannabe Vladislav, frilly dandy Viago, rebellious youngster Deacon, and ancient blood-sucking fiend Petyr--prowl the city's night streets for blood. But forever is boring, even for vampires. And then, a small documentary crew expresses interest in recording their lives, giving the strange companions a new lease of life. But trying to fit in the modern world is challenging enough, let alone when you're a vampire. And when the bloodsuckers turn their latest victim into a fresh vampire, unforeseen consequences threaten the group's delicate chemistry. But what will become of the den's warm-blooded guests? Don't they know that being a creature of the night is no bed of roses?—Nick Riganas"
