They spend a good deal of time together and it leads to love and marriage. The second Mrs. de Winter (Joan Fontaine) is somewhat overwhelmed however when, after their honeymoon, they return to his vast estate, Manderley.

    "A young woman is in Monte Carlo, working as a ladies' companion, when she meets the recently-widowered, and very wealthy, Maxim de Winter (Sir Laurence Olivier). They fall in love and get married soon thereafter. The de Winters take up residence in Maxim's family estate, Mandalay. Mrs. de Winter (Joan Fontaine) finds it hard to fit in. The presence of Maxim's deceased wife, Rebecca, seems to permeate through the house and Mrs. de Winter can't shake the feeling that she is constantly being compared to her, and that she is an interloper. Mrs. Danvers (Dame Judith Anderson), Rebecca's personal maid, also takes care to make things as uncomfortable as possible for the new Mrs. de Winter. Mrs. de Winter has the constant fear that memories of Rebecca will drive her and Maxim apart. Over time, she grows to know more and more about Rebecca.—grantss",
    "\"It wouldn't make for sanity, would it? Living with the devil?\" Rebecca (1940) by Robert E. Sherwood (screenplay), Joan Harrison (screenplay), and Daphne Du Maurier (novel) is a Psychological Thriller Romance about a naïve and unsophisticated, young woman that impulsively marries a wealthy widower, only to discover that he and his loyal housekeeper are still clinging to memories of his late wife, Rebecca. Themes of class, servitude, romance, and jealousy seem to dominate the narrative of this fish-out-of-water, whirlwind romance that hastily moves the awkward and nervous new bride (Joan Fontaine) into the fully-staffed seaside mansion \"Manderley\" of her paternalistic new husband, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). It's clear early on and all throughout the story, that the new bride's name is meant to be obscured, as she is only referred to and addressed as \"the young bride,\" \"madam,\" \"the child,\" \"darling,\" and \"dear.\" She meets the refined household staff, most of whom are gracious and welcoming, but quickly discovers that the stiff and formal, housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), does not approve of her. Mrs. Danvers is quite overt in her determination to psychologically bully the new Mrs. de Winter into thinking that the house (especially the west wing) should stay just as the greatly \"adored\" Rebecca left it (prior to drowning a year ago) and overtly convinces the new bride that her husband still loves his former wife. Mrs. Danvers' behavior in addition to Maxim's outbursts, persistent distancing, and uncertainty about their marriage increase the new Mrs. de Winter's nervousness and clinginess. At mid-point, the new bride finally asserts that Rebecca's belongings should be removed, and she desperately tries to convince Maxim that they are happily married. At the heart of this story is a trifecta of psychological instability. The seemingly \"broken\" Maxim is reeling from the death of Rebecca, not because he misses her, but because he feels responsible for her death. The easily pleased, new Mrs. de Winter, believes she is in love with the man she married and hardly knows (and has no family of her own), so she is terribly desperate to make their relationship work. The openly hostile Mrs. Danvers is so fiercely loyal to her former mistress and so wholly disillusioned about Maxim's grief, that she has no qualms about pushing Maxim's new wife to the brink of suicide. What's especially clever (and ominous) about Rebecca is that each of the main characters is being driven mad by the title character we never get to see. When considering the extreme and tragic ending in relation to the set-up and second act development, I think the overall presentation would have been better served by spending less time establishing the short courtship and more time building up Mrs. Danver's rapidly evolving insanity.—T.B. Hayes"

  "synopsis": "The film begins with a female voiceover: \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\", to images of a ruined country manor.The heroine is a very young (and nameless) woman (Joan Fontaine), a paid companion to the wealthy but obnoxious Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates). The heroine meets the aristocratic widower Maximilian (Maxim) de Winter (Laurence Olivier) in Monte Carlo. They fall in love, and within two weeks they are married.Maxim takes his new bride to Manderley, his country house in Cornwall, England. The housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), is domineering and cold, and is obsessed with the great beauty, intelligence and sophistication of the first Mrs. de Winterthe eponymous Rebeccaand preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. Rebecca's sleazy cousin Jack Favell (George Sanders) appears at the house when Maxim is away.The new Mrs. de Winter is intimidated by her responsibilities and begins to doubt her relationship with her husband. The continuous reminders of Rebecca overwhelm her; she believes that Maxim is still deeply in love with Rebecca. She also discovers that her husband sometimes becomes very angry at her for apparently innocent actions.Trying to be the perfect wife, the young Mrs. de Winter convinces Maxim to hold a costume party as he did with Rebecca. The heroine tries to plan her own costume, but Mrs. Danvers suggests she copy the beautiful outfit in the portrait of Caroline de Winter, an ancestor. At the party, when the costume is revealed to Maxim he is appalled; Rebecca wore the same outfit at their ball a year ago, shortly before she died. The heroine confronts Danvers, who tells her she can never take Rebecca's place, and almost manages to convince her to jump to her death. A sudden commotion reveals that a ship is sinking.The heroine rushes outside, where she hears that during the rescue a sunken boat has been found with Rebecca's body in it. Maxim admits that he had earlier misidentified another body as Rebecca's, in order to conceal the truth. At the very beginning of their marriage Rebecca had told Maxim she intended to continue the promiscuous and perverse sex life she had led before the marriage. He hated her but they agreed to an arrangement: she would act as the perfect wife and hostess in public, and he would ignore Rebecca's privately conducted affairs. Rebecca grew careless and complacent in her dealings, including an ongoing affair with her cousin Jack Favell. One night, Rebecca informed Maxim that she was pregnant with Favell's child. During the ensuing heated argument she fell, hit her head and died. Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled.Shedding the remnants of her girlish innocence, Maxim's wife coaches her husband on how to conceal the mode of Rebecca's death from the authorities. In the police investigation, deliberate damage to the boat points to suicide. Favell shows Maxim a note from Rebecca which seems to indicate she was not suicidal. Favell then tries to blackmail Maxim, but Maxim tells the police. Maxim is now under suspicion of murder. The investigation then focuses on Rebecca's secret visit to a London doctor (Leo G. Carroll), which Favell assumes was due to her illicit pregnancy. However, the coroner's interview with the doctor reveals that Rebecca was mistaken in believing herself pregnant; instead she had a late-stage cancer.The doctor's evidence persuades the coroner to render a finding of suicide. Only Frank Crawley (Maxim's best friend and manager of the estate), Maxim, and his wife will know the full story: that Rebecca lied to Maxim about being pregnant with another man's child in order to goad him into killing her, an indirect means of suicide.\nAs Maxim returns home from London to Manderley, he finds the manor on fire, set alight by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. The second Mrs. de Winter and the staff manage to escape the blaze, but Danvers dies in the flames.",
