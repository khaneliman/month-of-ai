    "Viola Hastings (Bynes) is in a real jam. Complications threaten her scheme to pose as her twin brother, Sebastian (James Kirk), and take his place at a new boarding school. She falls in love with her handsome roommate, Duke (Tatum), who loves beautiful Olivia (Ramsey), who has fallen for Sebastian. As if that were not enough, Viola's twin returns from London ahead of schedule but has no idea that his sister has already replaced him on campus.",
    "Here's the thing! Viola's soccer team at Cornwall gets cut. She wants to join the boys' team, but they do not allow girls. So she thinks, \"If you can't beat them, join them\". So she does! She disguises herself as her twin brother, Sebastian and goes out for the rival school, Illyria Boys' Soccer Team and makes it. Unfortunately, she didn't plan falling in love with her roommate Duke. But Duke has his eyes on Olivia. What makes matters worse is that Olivia starts to fall for Sebastian because he/she has a sensitive side. If things couldn't get more problematic, the real Sebastian (who was in London working on his music) comes home early. He arrives on campus and has no clue that he was replaced by his twin sister.—Barbara-Ann",

    "When Viola learns her soccer team is no more, she wants to join the boys team. The coach says no, so she dresses up like her brother Sebastian, and goes to his school for two weeks and pretends to be him. Her roommate Duke also plays soccer, and has a serious crush on a girl named Olivia. Olivia likes Sebastian, who is really Viola who really likes Duke. When Sebastian comes home, everything gets complicated!—anonymous"
