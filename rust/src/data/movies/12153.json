    "Two disgraced African American FBI agents, siblings Kevin and Marcus Copeland, are assigned the duty of protecting cruise-line heiresses Brittany and Tiffany Wilson from a kidnapping plot. Their supervisor, Elliott Gordon has given them this duty as a last resort to being fired from the agency given their recent reputation. When the Wilson sisters suffer facial scars from a car accident, they refuse to leave the hotel.

    "Two FBI agents, Kevin and Marcus, have gone undercover to bust a drug dealer, but their sting falls apart. Their boss gives them a new assignment to escort two hotel heiresses, Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, to the Hamptons. The FBI has received word that there is a plot to kidnap the sisters at the Hamptons. As they are driving from the airport to the Hamptons, the girl's little dog goes out the window, and causes them to have a wreck. The two girls end up with cuts on their faces in the wreck. Brittany and Tiffany take a stand, and refuse to go to the Hamptons looking like this. If they don't go, the kidnapping plot will not occur. Kevin and Marcus will fail again, and probably lose their jobs. They decide to disguise themselves as the Wilson sisters and catch the kidnappers.",
    "The plot begins in a convenience store where two FBI agents and brothers, Kevin Copeland and Marcus Copeland, try to capture members of an organization that sells drugs inside ice cream boxes (where in they disguise as old Caribbean men that are recipients of the drugs). A gunfight ensues, Kevin and Marcus finally knock out the criminals, leaving the place in shambles. But they soon find out that the men are actually selling real ice cream. Moments later, the real drug dealers arrive and escape. The FBI supervisor, Elliott Gordon and some agents arrive after the scene. The place gets very messy when they arrive. He gives the two agents a last chance to remain in the FBI by giving them the duty of protecting the mega-rich billionaire cruise line heiresses Brittany and Tiffany Wilson from a kidnapping plot (known as the socialite kidnappings). When the Wilson sisters get facial cuts in a car accident, they refuse to leave the hotel due to their appearance (despite the fact their cuts are barely noticeable). The agents then disguise themselves as white women in the form of Wilson sister look-a-likes in order to save their jobs. At the Hamptons hotel, Kevin and Marcus meet Brittany and Tiffany's three best friends, Karen, Tori and Lisa. They also meet their enemies Megan and Heather Vandegeld. Marcus' wife Gina gets suspicious when she hears a woman's voice while she was on the phone with Kevin. Their marriage goes through a bumpy road. Kevin shows an interest in the news reporter Denise Porter, they have a long bumpy road of trying to be men, Marcus for his wife and Kevin for Denise as well as trying to be women at the hotel. In the end they attend the \"white\" party, the real Tiffany and Brittany Wilson turn up and they don't know what to do, but something more important happens, they spot a suspicious man with a gun at the party."
