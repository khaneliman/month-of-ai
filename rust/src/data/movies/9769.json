    "An English professor falls for a minor, and has to face the consequences of his actions.",
    "In early adolescence, Humbert fell hopelessly and tragically in love with a girl his own age, and, as he grew into adulthood, he never lost his obsession with \"nymphets,\" teenagers who walk a fine line between being a girl and a woman. While looking for a place to live after securing a new teaching position, he meets Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith), a pretentious and annoying woman who seems desperately lonely and is obviously attracted to Humbert. Humbert pays her little mind until he meets her 13-year-old daughter Lolita (Dominique Swain), the image of the girl that Humbert once loved. Humbert moves into the Haze home as a boarder and eventually marries Charlotte in order to be closer to Lolita. When Charlotte finds out about Humbert's attraction to her daughter, she flees the house in a rage, only to be killed in an auto accident. Without telling Lolita of her mother's fate, Humbert takes her on a cross-country auto trip, where their relationship begins to move beyond the traditional boundaries of stepfather and step-daughter..",
    "New England, 1947. Having accepted a teaching post at Beardsley College, sophisticated professor of English literature Humbert Humbert rents a room at young widow Charlotte Haze's house in the quiet town of Ramsdale, New Hampshire. But there, an immediate fascination with Charlotte's lovely, soda-drinking 14-year-old daughter Dolores leads to a forbidden, all-consuming passion. Now, the wild flames of desire trap the grizzled academic in a dangerous game of seduction and obsession, attracting unwanted attention. Can Humbert escape the clutches of the destructive, unthinkable lust for gum-chewing Lolita, the unripe woman of his dreams?—Nick Riganas",
    "Humbert Humbert, a British professor coming to the US to teach, rents a room in Charlotte Haze's house, but only after he sees her 14-year-old daughter, Dolores (Lolita), to whom he is immediately attracted. Though he hates the mother, he marries her as this is the only way to be close to the girl, who will prove to be too mature for her age. They start a journey together, trying to hide they're not just (step)father and daughter, throughout the country, being followed by someone whom Humbert first suspects to be from the police. The profound jealousy, and maybe some guilt from the forbidden love, seem slowly to drive the man emotionally labile.—Luis Canau <luis..canau@mail.EUnet.pt>"
