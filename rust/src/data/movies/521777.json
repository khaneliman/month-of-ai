  "synopsis": "Friends Max (Jacob Tremblay), Lucas (Keith L. Williams), and Thor (Brady Noon) (The Beanbag Boys) enter sixth grade facing their own personal dilemmas: Max has a crush on classmate Brixlee (Millie Davis), Lucas learns his parents are getting divorced, and teasing from his peers discourages Thor from pursuing his love of singing. Soren is a popular student at school who continually baits Thor and makes fun of him for his \"feminine\" tastes such as singing. Thor does not have the courage to stand up to Soren and keeps suppressing his passions.When presented with the opportunity to kiss Brixlee at a party hosted by popular student Soren (Izaac Wang), Max and his friends use his father's valued drone to spy on his teenage neighbor Hannah (Molly Gordon) in an attempt to learn proper kissing. The plan goes awry and results in the drone being destroyed and Max, Lucas, and Thor in possession of Hannah's sex-ecstasy drug (which they stole from her house, when they went to beg for their drone back and Hannah chased them out).To avoid getting grounded, the three boys skip school to buy a new drone at the local mall, with Hannah and her friend Lily (Midori Francis) in pursuit. But they don't have any money, and thus plan to sell Lucas's baseball card which is worth almost $600. They still haven't managed to get rid of the drugs.At the last-minute Lucas gets cold feet and doesn't want to sell his card. So they end up selling Thor's dad's sex doll instead for the roughly the same amount of money. On the way to the mall, the boys stop at a convenience store where a cop also walks in. Lucas panics and hands over the drugs to the cop, who mistakes it for vitamins.Amid a series of escapades, Max, Lucas, and Thor reach the mall, but learn that Hannah and Lily bought the drone and will only give it to the boys in exchange for their ecstasy. Having surrendered the drugs to a police officer, the boys manage to obtain new ecstasy from Hannah's ex-boyfriend, Benji (Josh Caras), and trade it for the drone. Nevertheless, Max is unable to prevent his father from finding out that he used the drone and is grounded.An argument ensues between the friends and the three go their separate ways, although Max takes the blame for what transpired to prevent Lucas and Thor from getting in trouble. When Lucas speaks to his parents about the potential end of his friendships, they advise him that he, Max, and Thor are growing apart.\nThat night, Lucas convinces Max to sneak out to attend the party, tricking Max and Thor into meeting up again in the process. Max successfully kisses Brixlee while Lucas and Thor re-encounter Hannah and Lily, the latter revealed as Soren's sister, who encourage Thor to continue his passion for singing.In the ensuing weeks, Thor lands the role of Stacee Jaxx in the school's amateur production of Rock of Ages, Lucas joins the anti-bullying group at the school, and after his relationships with Brixlee and then her friend Taylor (Macie Juiles) end in heartbreak, Max begins dating his classmate Scout (Zoriah Wong). Following a performance of the school musical, Max, Lucas, and Thor reconcile and promise to remain in each other's lives.",
