    "Follows Stevie, a thirteen-year-old in 1990s-era Los Angeles who spends his summer navigating between his troubled home life and a group of new friends that he meets at a Motor Avenue skate shop.",
    "This movie follows a teenager named Stevie growing up in Los Angeles. He's struggling with his family, including his co-dependent single mom and his abusive older brother, and at school, where his richer friends seem to overlook him. When Stevie befriends a crew of skateboarders, he learns some tough lessons about class, race, and privilege.—Polly_Kat",
    "In the mid-1990s, 13-year-old Stevie lives in Los Angeles with his aggressive, fitness-obsessed older brother Ian and single mother Dabney. One day Stevie bikes past Motor Avenue Skateshop, admires the boastful camaraderie of skateboarders outside the shop, and returns the following day. Back home, Stevie trades with his brother for a skateboard, brings it to the shop and befriends young skater Ruben, who introduces him to the rest of the group: Ray, \"Fuckshit,\" and \"Fourth Grade.\" Although an inexperienced skater, Stevie is drawn to the group and aspires to imitate their daredevil behavior and anti-social attitudes. The group nicknames him \"Sunburn\". Ruben begins to resent Stevie because he feels he's being replaced as the \"younger kid\" in the group..",
    "Los Angeles, California, 1996. More than anything, Steve, a thirteen-year-old boy on the cusp between childhood and adolescence, wants to fit in. And having to deal with daily abuse and neglect, Steve is thrilled to get accepted by a riotous band of local skaters in their later teens. However, as Steve's passion for skateboarding evolves into an endless quest of rebellion and dangerous experiences, a summer of skating, bad decisions, and growing up unfolds.—Nick Riganas"
