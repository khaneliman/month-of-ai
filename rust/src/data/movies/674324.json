    "Set on a remote island off the west coast of Ireland, THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN follows lifelong friends Padraic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson), who find themselves at an impasse when Colm unexpectedly puts an end to their friendship. A stunned Padraic, aided by his sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon) and troubled young islander Dominic (Barry Keoghan), endeavours to repair the relationship, refusing to take no for an answer. But Padraic's repeated efforts only strengthen his former friend's resolve and when Colm delivers a desperate ultimatum, events swiftly escalate, with shocking consequences.",
    "In 1923 on the fictional Isle of Inisherin off the Irish Coast, two mates, Pádraic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson) engage in a row when Colm tells Pádraic \"I just don't like you anymore.\" Baffled by the proclamation, Pádraic persists in trying to make amends, meeting resistance from Colm at every turn. The row escalates under the watchful eyes of the entire village as Colm makes good on a gruesome promise. The threat of death-as if brought by a banshee-falls over the village as no one knows just how far the feud will go.—KS at ClassicCoupleAcademy.com",
    "Isle of Inisherin, Ireland, April 1923. They say all good things must come to an end. And unable to believe his ears, Pádraic, a good-natured dairy farmer living with his unmarried sister Siobhán, has no choice but to swallow his pride and deal with the sudden, bitter, irreversible reality: his closest friend Colm wants nothing to do with him anymore. But with adamant Colm determined never to speak with his former bosom buddy for the rest of his life, confused Pádraic teeters on the brink of collapse, trying to figure out what he did wrong. Meanwhile, as Colm gives Pádraic the cold shoulder and the silent treatment, pressing questions arise. Why has Colm so abruptly cut off his lifelong friend? In the end, what triggered Colm's unpredictable behavioural shift?—Nick Riganas"
