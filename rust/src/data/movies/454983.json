Tuppen, the student who touched Elle inappropriately later apologizes. Lee and Elle chat and he approves of her going on a date with Tuppen however Elle is stood up. He goes to see her later that night to let her know that he was threatened by Noah not to go out with her. And finds out that, Noah has told other guys besides Tuppen not to date Elle. Elle and Lee decide to create a kissing booth for the school carnival. The two have difficulty finding people to participate but get a group of popular girls called the OMG's to participate by lying to them about Noahs participation. The kissing booth is a success. However, girls become angry when they discover that Noah is not actually working the kissing booth. Therefore Elle is set up to kiss a nerdy kid while blindfolded however Noah interferes causing him to kiss Elle and when she takes off her blindfold he does it again.

  "synopsis": "Born on the same day in the same hospital, Elle Evans (Joey King) and Lee Flynn (Joel Courtney) have been best friends all their lives. They grow up together and do everything together. Specifically fond of dancing. Noah Flynn (Jacob Elordi) is Lee' elder brother and has always protected him from bullies. As Elle grows, she has a secret crush on Noah.\nElle is not into fashion and loves to play soccer. Along the way Elle loses her mom after a long battle with cancer. Well into her teens and Elle has never been kissed or even been on a date.To protect their special relationship, the pair created a set of friendship rules they are sworn to follow.\nRule #2 is never to share their secrets with anyone else.\nRule # 9 is that relatives are totally off limits.On the first day of her junior year in high school, Elle is forced to wear a too-small skirt after her regular pair of pants ripped apart when she put them on. When Tuppen (Joshua Eady) (a football player) touches her inappropriately, Noah begins fighting with him. Tuppen, Noah, and Elle are given detention, where Tuppen apologizes. Elle later agrees to go on a date with him, but he stands her up, as Noah has warned everyone not to pursue her.Lee wants to make out with college pin up Mia (Jessica Sutton). Mia is one of the college popular students called the OMG girls which also includes Olivia (Bianca Bosch) and Gwyneth (Zandile Madliwa).\nThe duo come up with the idea of a kissing booth at an upcoming fundraiser so that Lee has a chance to kiss Mia.\nMeanwhile Elle finds from Tuppen that Noah has been going around college threatening guys not to date Elle.To get their Kissing booth proposal passed from the student council, Elle promises that Noah will be working the booth (to get the girl votes on the council). Plus, she is hopping mad at Noah for trying to control her life.\nThat same night, Elle gets super drunk at a college party (after she sees Noah kissing another girl and egged on by the OMG girls) and takes off her clothes, at which point Noah intervenes and takes her to his home. Noah insists that he sees Elle as his little sister and hence is super protective of her.Meanwhile Elle still has no way of getting Noah to agree to doing the kissing booth. Elle tells the OMG girls that he likes one of them and if they are there, he will do the kissing booth. Elle then begs Noah to stop by the booth for some time as she is desperate.The kissing booth goes well until Noah is meant to participate but Lee takes his place, disappointing the OMG girls. A classmate, Rachel (Meganne Young), steps up to kiss him, and the two leave Elle to staff the booth.\nHowever, after a chance encounter at a kissing booth (Olivia tricks Elle into working the booth herself to avoid a pervert, only to find that Noah has taken his place who proceeds to kiss Elle), Elle finds her first love in Lee's bad-boy older brother, Noah Flynn.Noah offers Elle a ride on his motorcycle, and rain forces them to take shelter in a gazebo. There, she kisses him, but then tells him she won't be just another sexual conquest. Hurt, Noah reveals he has feelings for her.Soon a romance with Noah blossoms and Elle finds herself breaking the rules and hurting Lee. At a beach party, Warren (Byron Langley) tries to get a resistant Elle into a hot tub. Noah defends her, whereby Warren taunts him, so Noah attacks him while Elle escapes. Noah catches up to her and gives her a ride home. On the way, he apologizes for his violent reaction to Warren's slight. They detour to the Hollywood Sign and have sex for the first time. They establish rules for their relationship, with the principal aim that Lee not find out they are together until Elle figures out how to tell him.As Noah and Elle get closer and closer, Elle spends less time with Lee and that angers him off, bringing matters to head one day when Lee confronts Noah (when he sees Elle and Noah kissing in Noah's bedroom) and Elle has to step in to prevent a full blown fight.Lee feels very hurt as Elle was the only person in Lee's life that he considered his own rather than being a hand-me-down from Noah.\nNoah risks not graduating by being absent from school for the next few weeks, and Lee completely ignores Elle. Finally, she sees Lee at the arcade, where he invites her to dance with him, and they reconcile.\nAfter never-ending efforts from Elle, Lee finally forgives her.At the prom Noah finally says I love you to Elle and apologizes to her for fighting with Lee. Noah apologizes to Lee at home, telling him his feelings for Elle are serious despite the fact he is leaving for Harvard the next day.At Elle and Lee's birthday costume party the next day, Elle confesses her love for Noah to Lee. He relents, wanting her to be happy and agreeing to help her find Noah. Driving Lee's car, Elle shares her feelings for Noah with \"Lee\", dressed in his Batman costume, only to discover it is Noah in disguise.Elle and Noah spend the following weeks together before he leaves for college. Watching him go, she is unsure if their relationship will last, but she knows a part of her heart will always belong to him.",
