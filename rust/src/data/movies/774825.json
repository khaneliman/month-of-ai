    "Possum brothers Crash and Eddie set out to find a place of their own. Together with the one-eyed weasel, Buck Wild, they face the dinosaurs who inhabit the Lost World.",
    "Desperate for some distance from their older sister Ellie, the thrill-seeking possum brothers Crash and Eddie set out to find a place of their own, but quickly find themselves trapped in a massive cave underground. They are rescued by the one-eyed, adventure-loving, dinosaur-hunting weasel, Buck Wild, and together they must face the unruly dinosaurs who inhabit the Lost World.",
    "Dreaming of moving out and making their mark on the world, even though their adopted big sister Ellie believes they are not ready to be on their own, prehistoric possum twins Crash and Eddie summon up the courage to leave the nest after the events of Ice Age: Collision Course (2016). But it is a jungle out there. And before long, the tiny explorers wind up back in the dinosaur-ridden Lost World: the subterranean realm of expert survivalist Buck Wild, the extreme one-eyed weasel from Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), and a new megalomaniac villain bent on world domination. Do the reckless brothers have what it takes to survive reality?—Nick Riganas",
    "In order to prove to the rest of the group that they are independent and reliable on their own, Crash and Eddie set out to live their own lives. However, when they reunite with Buck, they are caught in a situation that may cost them their lives.—RECB3"
