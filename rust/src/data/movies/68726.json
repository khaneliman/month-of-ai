    "As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.",
    "When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.—Del Torro",
    "For years, Earth is repeatedly attacked by giant monsters called Kaiju that emerge from a portal beneath the Pacific Ocean. The only effective defense is the Jaeger program, massive complex robots that require pairs of neural-linked pilots. However, as each Kaiju attack becomes more powerful and frequent, Humanity must change its tactics. To that end, former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket is reactivated as part of a desperate plan to destroy the portal. As Raleigh strives to heal his inner scars and help his new partner conquer hers, an intrepid scientist discovers a way to link to the Kaiju's mind to learn about them. Unfortunately, that proves a mixed blessing as vital information of both sides is inadvertently shared and the stakes rise for a final battle.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)",
    "When giant lizard like creatures come out of the ocean and attack every city killing millions, all the nations come together and build giant robots called Jaegers. They are piloted by two individuals who are linked up to them mentally. While they are able to defeat the creatures whom they call Kaijus, eventually they adapt and even the Jaegers can't stop them. So all the heads of the nations decide to stop the program and to try other tactics. But Pentecost the man in charge of the Jaeger program decide to continue the program. He recruits Raleigh Becket a former Jaeger pilot who left after his co-pilot who's also his brother died. He tries to find a compatible co-pilot and when he finds no one, he gives Pentecost's assistant, a girl named Mako a chance. And when she proves to be the best, he wants her but Pentecost doesn't think she's ready. And when they try to hook up with their Jaeger, he sees what she's been through, which is what Pentecost was worried about. In the meantime, one of the scientists working on how to defeat the Kaijus thinks he found a way but he needs an actual Kaiju brain so Pentecost sends him to see a man who uses Kaiju remains to make a profit, so that he could get a Kaiju brain.—rcs0411@yahoo.com",
    "When Earth is invaded deep beneath the Pacific Ocean from a portal between dimensions in a breach by creatures called Kaijus, the governments join forces and realize that only monsters could destroy the Kaijus. The mankind builds the ultimate machines known as Jaegers, huge robots neurally controlled by two compatible pilots that have their minds interlocked. Years after, Kaijus become more powerful and a scientist discovers that they are part of an alien plan to destroy mankind first and exhaust the planet after. The former pilot Raleigh Becket, who lost his older brother Yancy Becket in a battle against a Kaiju, is summoned by Marshall Stacker Pentecost to fight again together with the rookie Mako Mori in the last hope of mankind.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"

  "synopsis": "In the near future, aliens identified as Kaijus have risen from a portal in a crevasse beneath the Pacific Ocean and started to attack coastal cities resulting in a war that takes millions of lives and quickly consumes humanity's resources. To combat the monsters, a special type of weapon is designed: massive, humanoid fighting machines, known as Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are bound in a neural link which lets them share the mental strain which would otherwise overwhelm a single pilot.The Jaegers are initially successful in fending off Kaiju attacks; however, over time, Kaijus cross through the portal at a faster rate, with each new Kaiju adapted for fighting the Jaegers. As they become less effective, Earth's united governments lose faith in the Jaegers' ability; the Jaeger program is terminated, with resources diverted to building a coastal fortification to protect coastal cities. The four remaining Jaegers are redeployed to Hong Kong to defend the unfortified coastline until the wall can be completed. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), commander of the Jaeger forces, devises a plan to end the war by using a nuclear warhead to destroy the portal.Pentecost approaches retired pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and convinces him to return and pilot Gipsy Danger, the Jaeger he and his brother Yancy once piloted. During a mission, Yancy was killed by a Kaiju while connected to his brother, traumatizing Raleigh. Arriving at Hong Kong, Raleigh tests with potential co-pilots to find one with a strong connection, as the stronger the connection, the better their performance in battle. Sensing a strong connection, Raleigh demands to be partnered with Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Pentecost opposes, as Mako is his adoptive daughter, but he eventually relents.The duo's initial test run nearly ends in disaster when Mako gets caught up in a childhood memory of a Kaiju attack; she inadvertently activates and nearly discharges Gipsy Danger's weapons while in the hangar. The duo are withdrawn from the field as the remaining Jaegers are tasked with fending off a double Kaiju attack in Hong Kong. The defense goes badly, with the Kaijus destroying two Jaegers, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha, and disabling a third Jaeger, Striker Eureka. Pentecost sends Raleigh and Mako to mount a last stand, and the duo drive off the assault.Meanwhile, Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day)-a scientist studying the Kaijus-assembles a machine allowing him to establish a mental link with a Kaiju brain fragment. The experience nearly kills him, but he discovers the Kaijus are actually artificial weapons sent to Earth as an invading force to allow another species to colonize the planet.With Pentecost's approval, he seeks out Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), a major figure in the trafficking of Kaiju parts, in an attempt to procure an intact Kaiju brain to repeat the experiment. Chau criticizes Geiszler's merging with the Kaiju brain, as he has attracted their attention, and the Kaiju attacking Hong Kong are seeking him. After Gipsy Danger kills the two Kaiju, Chau and his team move in to harvest parts. Geiszler realizes one of the Kaiju is pregnant; Chau and his crew are attacked by the newborn, which dies after eating Chau. Geiszler and his colleague Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) merge with the baby Kaiju's intact brain, where they discover the secret controlling the flow of Kaijus through the portal.The Jaeger forces reassemble to complete their plan to destroy the portal. Pentecost, revealed to have been one of the original Jaeger pilots, takes command of Striker Eureka as one of its usual pilots was injured in the defense of Hong Kong. Pentecost ventures into the ocean depths, with Raleigh and Mako supporting him. Geiszler and Gottlieb inform them the portal has a fail-safe system to control the passage of Kaijus and will only allow them to enter if they can mimic a Kaiju's genetic code.Before they can process this information, they are attacked by three Kaijus, including the largest on record. Pentecost detonates the warhead, sacrificing himself and Striker Eureka to kill the Kaijus guarding the portal. Raleigh and Mako seize a weakened Kaiju and enter the portal, intending to overload Gipsy Danger's nuclear reactors to use it as an improvised bomb. With the Jaeger critically damaged by the fight, Raleigh ejects Mako and manually overrides the safety protocols before ejecting himself. Gipsy Danger detonates on the other side of the portal, destroying it and the alien commanders, as the two pilots emerge safely on the sea's surface.In a post-credits scene, Chau-revealed to have survived-cuts his way out of the newborn Kaiju's stomach.",
