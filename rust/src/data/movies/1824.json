Both Henry and Lucy enjoy the company of each other and feel the start of a serious relationship occurring. Approaching Lucy the next day, Henry is confused when Lucy fails to recognize him. This is the moment Henry discovers that Lucy actually suffers from short term memory loss and can't remember each individual day. Henry won't let this stop him and is prepared to make her fall in love with him all over again, each and every day.—FilmFanUk",

That's the dilemma that playboy Honolulu veterinarian Henry Roth faces when after a multitude of one-night stands, he decides to settle down after a chance meeting with local artist Lucy Whitmore. Unfortunately for him, Lucy has short-term memory loss stemming from a car accident that happened a year earlier on her father Marlin's birthday; consequently, she can't remember anything that happened the day before, so each day, Henry must attempt to win her heart again. Additionally, Lucy's friends and family, including her older brother Doug, are very protective, so Henry must do everything possible to convince them that he's doing it for all the right reasons.—asbwtw",
