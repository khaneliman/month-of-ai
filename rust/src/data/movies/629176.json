    "A young boy learns that a superhero who was thought to have died after an epic battle twenty-five years ago may in fact still be alive.",
    "Thirteen-year-old Sam Cleary (Javon \"Wanna\" Walton) suspects that his mysterious and reclusive neighbor Mr. Smith (Sylvester Stallone) is actually a legend hiding in plain sight. Twenty Five years ago, Granite City's super-powered vigilante, Samaritan, was reported dead after a fiery warehouse battle with his rival, Nemesis. Most believe Samaritan perished in the fire, but some in the city, like Sam, have hope that he is still alive. With crime on the rise and the city on the brink of chaos, Sam makes it his mission to coax his neighbor out of hiding to save the city from ruin.—MGM",
    "20 years after the epic battle in which the superhero Samaritan destroyed the supervillain and went missing. Two decades later, a kid from the outskirts meets an old man who lives in the house opposite. Soon the boy realizes that the elderly man is the missing superhero, and the reason for his disappearance is truly shocking.—Bazza the Beast",
    "After surviving a life-altering tragedy, twin brothers became sworn enemies: Samaritan became the valiant protector of the innocent, and Nemesis evolved into a fierce antagonist with a mind aflame with revenge. Then, the benevolent defender vanished into thin air during the ultimate battle between good and evil, leaving the citizens of crime-ridden Granite City unprotected. But now, nearly three decades later, Samaritan's number one fan, Sam Cleary, is convinced he's found the missing superhero in the shape of Joe, a taciturn hermit and cryptic garbage collector. However, if Sam is right, the Samaritan's unforgiving arch-enemy just might be alive too.—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Superhumans Samaritan and Nemesis were antagonistic twin brothers who lived in Granite City. Evenly matched, the villainous Nemesis crafts a mystical sledgehammer that gave him an edge over the heroic Samaritan, and during a confrontation at the city's power plant, both were apparently killed as the plant exploded. Many people remain fans of Samaritan, and there are constant rumors that he is still alive.Twenty five years later, thirteen-year-old Sam Cleary tries his best to help his mother with their financial crisis, and, after being threatened with eviction, he accepts a job from a gang headed by Reza. The plan goes awry and Reza tries to blame Sam, but the real gang leader, Cyrus, is impressed and personally gives Sam $110. Reza and his friends later attack Sam as payback but are stopped by Joe Smith, a garbage collector who lives in an apartment across from Sam's. Joe displays super-strength in fighting off the gang members, and Sam suspects that he is Samaritan. Meanwhile, Cyrus locates Nemesis' hammer at a police station and sets himself up as the new Nemesis, sparking riots and chaos throughout the city, using EMP grenades to blackout and disrupt the city infrastructure.After Sam confronts him, Joe denies that he is Samaritan, but Reza - still looking for revenge - hits him with his car. Joe is badly injured but heals before Sam's eyes, overheating so much he has to be cooled down in a cold shower and by eating ice cream. Joe and Sam build a friendship, while at the same time Cyrus invites Sam to work with his gang. However, Sam is disturbed when he witnesses their violent activities.When Joe saves a young girl from an explosion caused by the gang, the media claims that Samaritan is back threatening Cyrus' plans. Reza recognizes Joe as being the same person he \"killed\" with his car and thus his identity and connection to Sam. Finding Joe's apartment empty, they kidnap Sam and his mother to lure Joe to their headquarters as a trap. Joe breaks into the headquarters, and decimates the gang before being confronted by Cyrus, now dressed as Nemesis and wielding the hammer. Despite his strength, Joe is weakened from the gang fight, and at a disadvantage against the hammer giving Cyrus the upper hand. As they fight, with Cyrus calling himself Nemesis, and Joe \"the good guy\", Joe reveals that Samaritan did die during the power plant fire, and Joe is actually Nemesis, who survived but left his villainous life behind. Destroying the hammer, Joe kills Cyrus by knocking him into a burning abyss - the same way he killed Samaritan - but almost overheats from his healing abilities and the spreading fire. Sam breaks open a pipe to shower him with water, allowing Joe to recover enough to escape with Sam by jumping out a window. Joe leaves, overhearing Sam tell the press that \"Samaritan\" saved him.",
