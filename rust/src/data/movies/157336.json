    "When Earth becomes uninhabitable in the future, a farmer and ex-NASA pilot, Joseph Cooper, is tasked to pilot a spacecraft, along with a team of researchers, to find a new planet for humans.",
    "Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life.—ahmetkozan",
    "In the near future around the American Midwest, Cooper, an ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his farming land with his daughter Murph and son Tom. As devastating sandstorms ravage Earth's crops, the people of Earth realize their life here is coming to an end as food begins to run out. Eventually stumbling upon a N.A.S.A. base 6 hours from Cooper's home, he is asked to go on a daring mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole because of Cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft unlike the other crew members. In order to find a new home while Earth decays, Cooper must decide to either stay, or risk never seeing his children again in order to save the human race by finding another habitable planet.—jmvd8",
    "In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand, a brilliant N.A.S.A. physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a womhole. But first, Brand must send former N.A.S.A. pilot Cooper and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.—Jwelch5742",
    "A single father that flew for NASA in the past is raising a son and daughter along with his father-in-law. After NASA was cut from governmental funding due to environmental problems, he becomes a farmer. The last sustainable crop is corn and it's only a matter of time until that too becomes extinct. Mysterious clues begin emerging that he and his daughter believe are coming from a supernatural being, or aliens. What they decipher leads them to a mission where he leaves the planet and his family to save mankind.—liamguts"

  "synopsis": "In the future, crop blight has caused civilization to regress into a failing agrarian society. Former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his family. Humanity needs more farmers to feed the world & the current scientific thinking believes that NASA Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviets (a belief that pisses Cooper off like nothing else). Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), Cooper's 10-year-old daughter, believes her room is haunted by a ghost trying to communicate with her. They discover the \"ghost\" is an unknown intelligence sending coded messages using gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in the dust that direct them to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Michael Caine). Dr Brand tells Cooper that every year one crop dies & gets eliminated from the planet forever due to change in climatic conditions & severity of the dust storms. Soon, no crop will ever grow on Earth & the species will starve to death.Brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence (& first discovered 48 yrs ago), leads to new planets that may offer hope for survival. NASA's \"Lazarus missions\" have identified three potentially habitable worlds orbiting the black hole Gargantua: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who surveyed them. Originally 12 astronauts were sent to 12 different worlds. Their craft had hibernation capabilities through which the astronauts could live on for decades & wait to be rescued after transmitting habitat data back to Earth. But if the planet was assessed to be uninhabitable, there was no plan for rescue as Earth did not have the resources to again visit all 12 planets. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to recover the astronauts' data from the 3 planets; if one of the planets is habitable, humanity will follow on space stations. But Brand has still not solved the problem of lifting enough of Humanity into space & to the identified planet. So plan B is to population bomb the identified planet with human embryos. The Endurance will carry 5000 human embryos, of which 10 will be incubated & once they grow up, they will be artificially inseminated so as to create a colony of 100s of humans in a few decades.\nCooper's departure devastates Murphy, and they part on bad terms.On Endurance, Cooper joins Brand's daughter, bio-technologist Amelia (Anne Hathaway) (& Brand's daughter); scientists Romilly (David Gyasi) and Doyle (Wes Bentley); and robots TARS and CASE. Amelia tells Cooper that Mann was the leader of the expedition that took 12 brave people to uncharted territory. Amelia has great respect for Mann.They enter the wormhole and head to Miller (as the meager data provided by the respective explorers puts Miller's planet as the best option), but discover the planet is so close to Gargantua that it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: each hour on the surface is seven years on Earth. A team descends to the planet, which proves inhospitable as it is covered by a shallow ocean roiled by enormous tidal waves. As Amelia attempts to recover Miller's data, a wave hits, killing Doyle and delaying the shuttle's departure. When the others return to Endurance, 23 years have passed. Murphy is now grown up & is working with Dr Brand (who is now very old) in solving the gravity equation that is the key to lifting the humanity off Earth in an attempt to recolonize another planet, as per Plan A.On Earth, the adult Murphy (Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with an equation that will enable NASA to launch the space stations via gravity. On his deathbed, Brand admits he already solved the gravity problem and determined that project is impossible as he needed more data from a black hole singularity to completely solve the equation. He concealed his findings to keep hope alive and put his faith in \"Plan B\": using frozen embryos aboard the Endurance to start humanity anew. He also knew that there was no way back to Earth via the wormhole. However, Murphy concludes that Brand's equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity.Low on fuel, Endurance can only visit one more planet before returning to Earth. After a tense vote, the team selects Mann's planet, as Mann is still transmitting. Amelia wanted to take Endurance to Edmund's planet as the data showed organic life, but Mann's data was more recent (but showed no organic life). Amelia's theory was that the 3 planets were orbiting a giant black hole & hence all accidents that happened in the universe to create life, simply did not happen in this system, so no asteroids, comets nothing. Her point was that planet showing organic life hence had more promise.However, they discover Mann's planet is icy and inhospitable; Mann (Matt Damon) always knew Plan B was the mission's true goal (he even tells Cooper that Brand knew that he needed a black hole's singularity data before Mann left Earth. And Singularity data is impossible as it hides behind a black hole, through which light itself cannot escape). Romily suggests that the robot TARS can enter the black hole horizon of Gargantuan fast enough & just might survive long enough to transmit data on the singularity. Mann faked data about his planet's viability so Endurance would rescue him. Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, and flees to Endurance on a shuttle; Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann set to protect his secret. Amelia rescues Cooper on the other shuttle, and they arrive at Endurance in time to witness Mann docking improperly. The airlock explodes, killing Mann and causing serious damage, but Cooper uses the shuttle to get Endurance under control.Nearly out of fuel, Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua on a course toward Edmunds. Due to being directly in the heavy gravity of Gargantua, several more decades actually pass back on Earth while TARS and Cooper detach into the black hole, sacrificing themselves to collect data on the singularity and to propel Amelia by dropping the ship's mass. They emerge in an extra-dimensional \"tesseract\", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murphy's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realizes the alien beings are future humans who have constructed this space so he can communicate with Murphy and save humanity. Using gravitational waves, Cooper encodes TARS's data on the singularity into the adult Murphy's watch, allowing her to solve Brand's equation and evacuate Earth. Cooper somehow is ejected from the singularity & awakens aboard a NASA space station near Saturn and reunites with the now elderly Murphy (Ellen Burstyn), who has led humanity's exodus. Murphy convinces Cooper to search for Amelia and CASE, who have completed their one-way trip to Edmunds' planet, and are setting Plan B into motion.",
