    "A grieving couple retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping to repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage, but nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse.",
    "Concerned about the emotional deterioration of his grieving, glassy-eyed wife, a guilt-ridden therapist attempts to treat her atypical grief on his own. And as the broken-hearted couple seeks answers and closure in the heart of a verdant terrestrial paradise, they embark on a self-therapeutic journey into their darkest fears. Instead, trust invites more pain, entangling the man and the woman into a primitive, four-chapter ritual of unprocessed feelings and profound sadness. But in the absence of the divine, is the catharsis of punishment the highest form of forgiveness?—Nick Riganas"
