    "A reclusive, morbidly obese English teacher attempts to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter.",
    "Idaho, 2016. Scarred by the profound wounds of grief and guilt, couchbound Charlie, an online writing instructor living with chronic obesity, now has a crystal-clear view of his secret intentions. And confined to his claustrophobic and musty apartment, the self-destructive shut-in has all the time in the world to contemplate the damaging faults of the past, fatherhood, and reconciliation. Because, more than anything, flawed Charlie longs for communication and reconnection. After all, he hasn't spoken to his estranged, angry teenage daughter Ellie in years. But everyone knows whales don't live in the shallows. Do love and forgiveness have the power to wipe away the tears and the painful mistakes of a lifetime?—Nick Riganas",
    "Charlie is an online teacher and lives alone in Idaho. He is morbidly obese, to the point that, despite the best intentions of his nurse Liz, he probably does not have long to live. He is desperate to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter before he dies.—grantss",
    "A morbidly obese English teacher, Charlie, is desperately trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie, before he completely runs out of time. Having only days to live, Charlie will do whatever it takes to prove himself a worthy father to Ellie: to prove that's he's done one thing right in his life before he's gone.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187"
