    "Arthur Curry, the human-born heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, goes on a quest to prevent a war between the worlds of ocean and land.",
    "Born upon the shores of the surface world, Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) discovers that he is only half human, with the other half of his blood being of Atlanteean descent, thus making him the rightful heir to the throne of the undersea kingdom of Atlantis. However, Arthur learns that Atlantis is being ruled by his malicious half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms and wage war upon the surface. With aid from Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the gorgeous Mera (Amber Heard), Arthur must discover the full potential of his true destiny and become Aquaman in order to save Atlantis and the surface from Orm's evil plot.—Blazer346",
    "Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) has always been different. His mother was an honorable Queen of Atlantean descent, while his father, a simple human lighthouse keeper. They met after she fled to land, running from her forced fiancée. A few years later, Arthur is a toddler, when his mother was forcefully and reluctantly taken back to Atlantis, where she was believed to be executed. Fast forward and Arthur is now an adult. After learning the truth about his destiny, he sets out to find a King's lost trident and stop an entire war before it even starts.",
    "Born to the humble lighthouse keeper, Thomas, and the powerful queen of Atlantis, Atlanna, Arthur Curry reluctantly embarks on a dangerous mission to find his roots. But, with his mother nowhere to be found, Arthur, who thinks he has harnessed his unlimited Atlantean abilities, finds himself on a collision course with his spiteful half-brother, King Orm. More and more, conflict is brewing, as Orm is trying to stir up a violent war with the surface dwellers, and crown himself Master of the Ocean after uniting the seven undersea kingdoms. Now, Arthur, along with his ally, the brave Atlantean Princess, Mera, must follow a faint trail of clues to find the Trident of Atlantis, a magic weapon that belonged to its first ruler, Atlan, and avert a devastating final confrontation between the two realms that would mean the death of billions. Will Arthur embrace his destiny and claim his rightful throne?—Nick Riganas",
    "A male who was raised and trained on land discovers that he is a prince and the rightful heir of an underwater kingdom. With a war planned to break out between land and water, he must travel to the underwater kingdom to prevent it from happening.—RECB3"

  "synopsis": "The story opens in the small, seaside village of Amnesty Bay, Maine, in 1985. On a very stormy night, lighthouse keeper Thomas Curry (Temeura Morrison) discovers an unconscious woman (Nicole Kidman) washed up on the shore with a wound in her abdomen. He brings her to his home and shelters her. Although she appears frightened and confused when she wakes up, Thomas shows her kindness and tends to her wound. She tells him her name is Atlanna, queen of Atlantis, and the two begin a romantic relationship.Thomas and Atlanna spend the next few years together, and they become parents to a son, Arthur. Everything seems lovely until one day when a team of Atlantean commandos burst into their home and start to attack with the intention of taking Atlanna back to her betrothed, King Orvax. Atlanna fights back and beats the commandos down, leaving her time to get away with Thomas and Arthur. Atlanna tells Thomas she must return to Atlantis for his and Arthur's safety, but she vows to return to both of them someday. She kisses Thomas goodbye and jumps back into the ocean, leaving Arthur her five-tined sea fork for when he is ready to use it.Years later, we see Arthur as a child on a school field trip to the aquarium. He is seen talking to the fish, and two bullies start to taunt and mock him for it. A shark then starts banging on the glass, cracking it slightly and scaring everyone else. They watch in astonishment as all the sea creatures gather right behind Arthur, and his eyes glow yellow as he has them at his command.Twenty years later, a team of pirates led by Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) and his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) take over a Russian submarine. After subduing the men on board, the villains find that they hit something, or rather, something hit them. It's the now adult Arthur (now played by Jason Momoa), better known by many as Aquaman, coming to the rescue. He makes his way into the sub and starts fighting the pirates, laying them all out with ease before going after the Kanes. Jesse fires an RPG at Arthur, thinking he's killed him, but Arthur picks himself up, mostly unscathed. Arthur retaliates by piercing Jesse in the chest. The sub starts to take on water, and Jesse is pinned under a torpedo. David desperately tries to free his father and pleads for Arthur's help, but he refuses to save Jesse because he and his son have killed innocent people. David continues trying to free Jesse, but he knows his time is almost up, and he pulls out a grenade before ordering David to get out and to go kill Arthur. David reluctantly listens and climbs out of the sub as he hears Jesse set off the grenade. Arthur rescues the other Russian crewmen while David escapes in another sub.Arthur joins Thomas as he waits on the docks for Atlanna as he has all these years. The two go to a bar where they see a news report of Aquaman's heroics, and Thomas knows it was his son. He reminds Arthur how he is meant to unite both the surface world and the kingdom of Atlantis. A group of bikers then approach Arthur, seemingly looking for a fight, but they actually just want to take pictures with him.Down in Atlantis, Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is with Arthur's mentor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) as they prepare to meet with King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren). Orm wants Nereus to form an alliance with him in a supposed effort to unite the other kingdoms of the sea. However, Orm's real intent is to build an army large enough to attack the surface world, believing they will strike Atlantis first. Nereus is also aware of Arthur's existence, though Orm refuses to acknowledge his half-brother or that his mother lived among the surface dwellers. Just then, a blast hits the area, an attack by a human submarine. Orm and Nereus round up their forces to strike back, and Orm sends the sub crashing to the lowest depths of the ocean. Nereus is then convinced to side with Orm as they prepare to send a message to the surface.That evening, Arthur and Thomas are leaving the bar when Arthur is found by Princess Mera (Amber Heard), daughter of Nereus. She warns Arthur that Orm is planning to wage war on the surface, and that the lives of people both on land and sea will be in danger. Arthur doesn't seem interested, even as Mera tells him that Vulko has found a path to the long lost Trident of Atlan, which can be used to defeat Orm and allow Arthur to claim his place as king of Atlantis. Arthur remains unmoved, due to his belief that the Atlanteans executed his mother, but he promises to handle Orm his own way if he does attack.Meanwhile in the North Sea, Orm and his commandos meet with David. Orm hands David his payment (in gold coins), but David wants to get his hands on Aquaman whom he blames for the death of his father.A massive tidal wave heads toward the mainland as Arthur and Thomas are driving home. It strikes their truck and forces Arthur out. He frantically swims back to his father, but with Mera's help, they are able to get Thomas out of the water and revive him. Arthur looks upon the now devastated land and is convinced to join her to stop Orm.The two head toward a cliff side to dive into the ocean, the same place where Vulko taught Arthur how to swim, master his Atlantean instincts and fight with his mother's sea fork. Arthur and Mera board her watercraft and ride past Atlantis to a sunken ship where Vulko waits. He tells Arthur that the legend of Atlan's trident is real, as it belonged to the founding king Atlan (Graham McTavish) and was forged from powerful steel, designed to allow someone worthy to rule over Atlantis. Back then, Atlantis prospered on the surface and made impressive technological advancements, but their drive for power ultimately brought their downfall, and Atlantis sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
