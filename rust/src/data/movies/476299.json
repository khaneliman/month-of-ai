    "A mother of two who inherits a house is confronted with murderous intruders on the first night in their new home and fights for her daughters' lives. Sixteen years later when the daughters reunite at the house, things get really strange.",
    "Pauline and her two daughters, Beth and Vera, inherit the house of their recently deceased aunt. However, during the first night in their new home, some psychopaths enter the house causing the mother to go to the extreme to save the lives of her daughters. Sixteen years later, Beth has become a famous horror author who has a perfect life. For her part, Vera is now a woman who does not know how to cope alone and has a continuous sense of paranoia. Mother and daughters will meet again in the family home and a series of strange events will begin to take place.",
    "Sixteen years after that soul-scathing incident at their late aunt's dilapidated mansion in the middle of nowhere, traumatised sisters, Beth and Vera, and their single mother, Pauline, have somewhat managed to put the past behind them. However, one delirious call from the frail and mentally unstable Vera will drag the now flourishing horror novelist Beth back to the old place of torment, as recurring visions of the past's unfathomable horrors still haunt the family. But, are the butchers in the siblings' nightmares real in the first place, or is this frenzied plunge into the uncharted waters of the human psyche what pure paranoia looks like?—Nick Riganas"
