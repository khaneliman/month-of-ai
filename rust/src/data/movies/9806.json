    "While trying to lead a quiet suburban life, a family of undercover superheroes are forced into action to save the world.",
    "Bob Parr (A.K.A. Mr. Incredible), and his wife Helen (A.K.A. Elastigirl), are the world's greatest famous crime-fighting superheroes in Metroville, always saving lives and battling evil on a daily basis. But 15 years later, they have been forced to adopt civilian identities and retreat to the suburbs where they have no choice but to retire as superheroes to live a \"normal life\" with their three children Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack, who were born with secret superpowers. Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment. He soon discovers that it will take a super family effort to rescue the world from total destruction.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}",
    "In this lauded Pixar animated film, married superheroes Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are forced to assume mundane lives as Bob and Helen Parr after all super-powered activities have been banned by the government. While Mr. Incredible loves his wife and kids, he longs to return to a life of adventure, and he gets a chance when summoned to an island to battle an out-of-control robot. Soon, Mr. Incredible is in trouble and it's up to his family to save him.—Jwelch5742",
    "Fed up with the local masked crime fighters and superheroes, the people of Metroville have decided they can do without them. As a result, fifteen long years and several lawsuits later, once-popular super-strong defender Bob Parr and his exceptional elastomer-limbed wife Helen now lead an ordinary suburban life as civilians with their equally extraordinary three kids. However, a mysterious invitation jolts Bob into action. At last, for the first time in a long while, Mr Parr feels useful, free to do what he does best. But once more, the Earth is in danger. Can the long-forgotten Incredibles save the day?—Nick Riganas",
    "Superheroes are no longer a secret to the world; their identities are known to the US Government and they've become model citizens in a conforming world. But heroes know no limits to persistence. Retired superhero Mr. Incredible receives a mysterious message from a mysterious woman on a seemingly deserted island. Little does Mr. Incredible realize that he'll soon be in the cross-hairs of a conspiracy involving all the world's superheroes.—Johnny"

  "synopsis": "In a retro-futuristic version of the 1960s, a superhuman named Robert \"Bob\" Parr (better known by his superhero alias \"Mr Incredible\") fights crime as an undercover superhero using his powers of super-strength in the city of Metroville (a parody of Metropolis). one afternoon while on the way to his wedding, Bob helps an elderly woman with her cat, stops a police car chase, prevents the suicide of the local bank president Oliver Sansweet and attempts to prevent a French clown-like super-villain named Bomb Voyage from robbing the Metroville Bank. whilst attempting to save the bank, a 10-year-old fan boy named Buddy Pine wants to be Mr Incredible's sidekick, and unintentionally interferes, causing Bomb Voyage to get away and blow up part of a monorail system. Bob makes it to his wedding late and marries his longtime girlfriend Helena Truax (better known by her super-heroine alias \"Elastagirl\", who is also a superhuman and is capable of changing the shape and size of her body via stretching). shortly after their marriage, Mr Incredible is sued in Superior Court by Oliver Sansweet and the injured train passengers, leading to the government eventually banning all super-humans from using their superpowers in public.15 years later, Bob and Helen are now living a quiet suburban life with their three new children, Violet Parr (a 15-year-old social outcast who has the powers of invisibility and force fields), Dashiell Robert \"Dash\" Parr (a 10-year-old sporty troublemaker who has the power of super-speed) and Jacob \"Jack-Jack\" Parr (an infant capable of multiple superpowers unknown to the family). the family is often now struggling with everyday life problems and is sometimes dysfunctional, and Bob is bored with his new job as a clerk for the business company Insuricare, thus secretly trying to sneak out at night as a masked vigilante with his longtime best friend Lucious Best (better known by his superhero alias \"Frozone\", who is also a superhuman and has the power of freezing things). one day, Bob loses his temper with his grumpy boss Mr Gilbert Huph who refuses to let him stop a nearby mugging during a private meeting, and Bob angrily smashes him through the office and is fired. when he arrives home, worrying what Helen will think, Bob finds a message from an overseas scientist named Mirage who tells him she is working for a base on a remote island and they need his help to shut down an out-of-control AI-controlled robot known as the \"Omnidroid\" which is terrorising their laboratory. Bob sees this as an opportunity to become a superhero again, and leaves, telling Helen that he has been sent to a conference.as Mr Incredible, Bob is flown overseas to a tropical jungle island. Mirage warns him that the Omnidroid has an advanced artificial intelligence and is designed to teach itself, so that Bob should not fight it too much. Bob lands in the jungle, and the Omnidroid appears, revealing its appearance as a gigantic octopus-like droid. Bob battles with the machine, finding it almost invincible, but eventually manages to destroy it in a volcano. after he is sent home, Bob notices a tear in his costume and seeks the help of his fashion designer, Edna \"E\" Mode. Edna tells Bob that he cannot use a cape during battles, due to many superheroes in the past dying from cape-related accidents, and she designs him a new red and yellow suit to replace his old blue and red suit. incorrectly assuming he has told his family about going back into superhero business, Edna decides to design new suits for the entire family.Bob is sent back to the island to have a meeting with Mirage, but when he arrives, he discovers that Mirage is really a secret agent who is the second-in-command for a crime lord and cereal killer known as \"Syndrome\", and his mission was only a test for the Omnidroid's abilities. Bob is attacked again by the now-updated Ominidroid and Syndrome appears. Syndrome reveals himself to really be an adult Buddy Pine who now seeks revenge on Bob for rejecting him as a sidekick. Syndrome throws Bob into a lake and attempts to kill Bob with a miniature bomb, but Bob escapes via swimming through a cave, though Syndrome assumes him to be dead.at nightfall, Bob sneaks into Syndrome's secret base lair and looks into his computer files. Bob finds that Syndrome has been secretly planning and thus far succeeding in a mass genocide scheme known as \"Operation: Kronos\", and has been testing previous Omnidroid replicas via killing past superheroes and has plans already to kill Helen. suddenly, Mirage catches Bob and Syndrome has him imprisoned.meanwhile, Helen notices the tear in Bob's costume and visits Edna to have it mended. Edna, assuming she knows what Bob has been up to, shows Helen all the suits she has made for the family.
