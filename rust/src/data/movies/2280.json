After Zoltar tells him, \"Your wish is granted,\" he notices that it's unplugged. He wakes up the next morning in an adult's body, but he still has the same personality. With the help of his best friend, Billy, he learns how to act like an adult. But as he gets a girlfriend and a fun job, he doesn't want to be a kid again. Will Josh stay big or become a 13-year-old boy again?",
    "Tired of being pushed around, thirteen-year-old Josh Baskin, is convinced that all his problems would disappear if only he were an adult. Then, as if by magic, he receives a helping hand from Zoltar, a mysterious wishing machine, and just like that, he wakes up the following morning in the body of a thirty-year-old version of himself. At last, his wish came true beyond his wildest imagination, however, it seems that being an adult is not a walk in the park. Now, he will have to look for a job, and above all, keep his extraordinary secret safe as the perks of childhood slowly fade away. But is this what he truly wished for?â€”Nick Riganas",

    "A young boy named Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes on a carnival machine to be big, despite the fact that he does not believe that it is going to work. He is very surprised, therefore, to find himself so the next morning. Now he looks like a 30-year-old man, but he still behaves like a thirteen-year-boy. He decides to go with his best friend, Billy (Jared Rushton), to New York City to find the machine that can undo his wish. There, he gets a job at a toy company and develops a relationship with a woman named Susan (Elizabeth Perkins). Currently, he must learn to get used to the adult world he always wanted to be part of. Would he like to remain an adult?â€”rsilberman"

  "synopsis": "Twelve-year-old, Josh Baskin is in line to go on a ride at a carnival. Directly behind him is a cute girl he knows from school, who strikes up a conversation with him. When he gets to the front, he is smaller than the wooden cutout used to determine whether one is big enough to go on the ride, and he is extremely humiliated. Moments later, he puts a coin in a fortune-telling machine and is told to make a wish. In the wake of his embarrassment, he, innocently enough, wishes that he were big.To his astonishment, when Josh awakes the next morning, his wish has been granted. Though still a twelve-year-old child in every respect but physically, he is no longer recognizable to his mother, he must leave home and, once he learns that resolving his problem will take a long time, has no choice but to try to make his own way This means getting a job and mingling in the world of adults. As it turns out, the job he gets at a toy manufacturer is perfect for him, as his insight into what toys kids will like greatly impresses senior management, and leads to an executive position.Handsome with an understandably youthful exuberance, Josh is attractive to a female executive in his company, and the result is a romantic interlude which, due to his inexperience, he is largely incapable of handling. Eventually, he shares his secret with her, but, at first, she doesn't believe him. As she gets a closer and closer look at his behavior, however, she comes to understand.Finally, Josh finds the arcade machine that had granted his wish and wishes to have the original wish undone, returning to his mother after weeks away form home.The real beauty of the movie lies in the realization that an adult that manages to maintain the exuberance of youth is one to be greatly envied, and while the means by which this message is conveyed is highly unconventional, the message is delivered with insight and clarity.",
