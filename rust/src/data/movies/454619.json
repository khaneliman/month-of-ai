    "After a spoiled, wealthy yacht owner is thrown overboard and loses his memory, a mistreated employee convinces him that he is her working-class husband.",
    "Kate Sullivan is a single mom of three daughters who works two jobs while studying to be a nurse. She is assigned to clean carpets on a yacht owned by spoiled, arrogant playboy Leonardo 'Leo' Montenegro. Leo makes rude remarks towards Kate and fires her without pay when she refuses to bring him food. When Kate calls out his behavior, Leo pushes her off the boat along with her cleaning equipment. Meanwhile, in Mexico, Leo's sisters Magdalena and Sofia are tending to their ailing father. Furious when Leo is announced as his successor to run the family-owned company, Magda decides to visit him. That night, Leo slips off the yacht and falls into the ocean unnoticed. He wakes up on a beach with amnesia and no recollection of his identity. He wanders through town and eventually reaches the hospital. Magda finds him and leaves him there unclaimed after learning he has amnesia. She returns home and falsely reports that Leo has died. Sofia suspects Magda is lying..",
    "Three long decades after the life-altering events that took place in Overboard (1987), yet another case of severe amnesia stirs old memories in Elk Cove, when the haughty heir and extravagant philanderer, Leonardo, ends up in the quiet community's local hospital. Now, it's the perfect time for retribution--and as Leonardo's wronged former employee and hard-working single mother of three, Kate, decides to pay him back in the same coin--the stage is set for the ultimate lesson in humility. In everyone's eyes, poor \"Leo\" is Kate's missing husband who struggles to provide for the family while trying his best to remember his shadowy past; nevertheless, will this improbable couple survive the inevitable revelations, and the unanticipated complications of love?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Kate Sullivan (Anna Faris) is a single, working-class mother of three who's hired to clean a luxury yacht that belongs to Leonardo Montenegro (Eugenio Derbez) a selfish, spoiled, and wealthy Mexican playboy. Kate is working 2 jobs and has 3 daughters. She is studying to become a nurse and works her ass off to make ends meet for her family. She is alone and she lost her hubby and has asked her mother to come stay with her to look after her kid.Sofia Montenegro (Mariana Trevino) is Leonardo's sister. Their father is on the deathbed, but loves Leo, even though he is a worthless playboy. Sofia is much more disciplined, but is always left on the sidelines, due to their father's bias.After unjustly firing Kate (he asks her to bring some snacks right after he fires his chef on the spot and she refuses), that very night, Leonardo falls off the boat and wakes up with no memory of who he is. He washes on a beach and is admitted to a hospital. The authorities call Sofia to take his possession. A doctor tells her that if no next of kin if found, amnesia patients are sent to a psych center, from which they seldom return. Sofia, spotting an opportunity, refuses to identify Leo as her brother & declares him dead to her lawyers. The doctors and the police are clueless as to who Leo is & treat him like a homeless person.Kate spots Leo's news on the internet, Theresa (Eva Longoria) (Kate's only friend in the world) advises her to take advantage of the situation. To get payback, Kate shows up at the hospital and convinces the confused amnesiac that they're married. Kate takes Leo home and her 3 kids go along with the charade as they need a babysitter who watches them till Kate passes the nursing exam. Kate tells Leo that their kids were conceived by a sperm donor, as Leo is sterile.Theresa gets her husband to get Leo a job at his construction site. Meanwhile Sofia tells her dad that Leo is dead. At home or at work, folks are always having fun at Leo's expense and running him ragged. But deep-down Leo is a good man, as he fixes the roof of Kate's house, teaches her kids to ride a bike and is supportive around the house.\nFinally, the test happens. Meanwhile Leo's father gets better. Kate wants to tell Leo about who he really is, but she can't muster the courage and tells him it's their anniversary instead. Leo takes them out. They eventually kiss & also have sex. Kate passes the nursing exam, and the charade continues, although Kate did want to reveal the truth to Leo.One day, at the beach, the ex-chef (fired by Leo earlier) takes a pic of him with the family and sends it to the boat captain, who shows it to Leo's dad. They immediately head to Kate's house, where Leo identifies them all as soon as he sees them. He is cured. Leo realizes that Kate lied to him, and he is angry. He leaves with his family. Kate and her girls are devastated.Eventually Kate and the girls get a boat and intercept Leo's yacht at sea. Leo also realizes that he misses his family. He jumps out of his yacht, when his father refuses to stop for them. Leo leaves with Kate. Sofia sends Leo the deeds to the yacht (worth more than 60 MM USD, since it was a gift from his father to him and the deed is still in his name). Leo and Kate are suddenly rich, and they get married.",
