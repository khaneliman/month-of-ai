    "A man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him cannot stand idly by when he meets a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters.",
    "Robert McCall is a former special service commando who faked his own death in hopes of living out a quiet life. Instead, he comes out of his self-imposed retirement to save a young girl, and finds his desire for justice reawakened after coming face-to-face with members of a brutal Russian gang. McCall becomes the go-to man when the helpless require the kind of vengeance they would never find without his skills.",
    "Haunted by his mysterious past, Boston hardware store employee Robert McCall now leads a silent, low-profile existence to appease his inner demons. But the past always returns with a vengeance. And when Robert's platonic late-night companion Teri ends up in the hospital after a nearly fatal encounter with the brutal Russian mob, the insomniac ex-virtuoso of pain must again put his deadly skill set to good use. As the pitiless guardian angel equalises the odds, feral retribution rains down on everyone involved. Who will live to tell the tale when Robert's bloody ballet of death ends?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) gets up early to go to work at Home Mart. McCall has an OCD that makes him time everything he does, from getting ready for work to just washing the dishes. He is respected and well-liked amongst his co-workers who have no idea of his past. On this day, he has lunch with his friend and co-worker Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) whom he is in the process of helping lose weight. He questions Ralphie about his lunch and is satisfied with his answers until Ralphie takes a bite out of his sandwich and McCall hears a crunch and finds out there are chips in the sandwich. McCall reminds Ralphie he's supposed to be dropping weight for his test to become a security guard. He also reminds him to always aim for progress, not perfection.Most nights, McCall can't sleep so he took to going to a local 24/7 diner where he reads books and drinks tea. He is currently reading \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" A young prostitute (Chloë Grace Moretz), with whom it is implied Robert talks to every now and then, asks McCall if the man in the book has caught the fish. He says not yet. The girl finishes her pie and goes to hail a cab.At work, a couple of McCall's young coworkers ask him what he used to do before working with them. He jokes that he was a Pip with Gladys Knight, doing a little dance for them.He goes back to the diner that night and runs into the same girl. She notices he's reading a new book. Robert tells her how the other one ended. As they are talking, a limo pulls up across from the diner. She then gets a call from her pimp, Slavi (David Meunier). He tells her she has a client, which is the man in the limo. She tells her pimp she doesn't want to work with this client because she finds him disgusting but her pimp ignores her feelings and tells her to go to work. The car door opens to reveal an obese man waiting for the girl. Reluctantly, she goes outside and joins him.The next night, McCall finds the girl at the diner but she has a bruise on her face. He gives her a doughnut that he got from work. Nervous, looking for a quiet voice, she decides to break their usual protocol and sits with him at his table. She introduces herself as Teri, although her real name is Alina. She hands McCall a CD that she recorded of herself singing hoping to get his opinion later. She aptly deduces that Robert has been recently windowed and still feels lost without his wife. Robert confirms she guessed right and reveals that his reading habits are inspired by a reading challenge his wife couldn't finish. The two of them leave the diner talking and walking for a while. As they're about to part ways for the night, a car pulls up to them. It is Slavi and his driver Tevi (Alex Veadov). Slavi gets out and slaps Alina. McCall considers interfering but is called off by Alina. Robert notices Tevi has a gun in his hand. Slavi walks over to McCall and hands him a card for his business and suggests he picks another girl.McCall then goes through a few days and nights without seeing Alina and is obviously worried about her. One night, he learns from the diner's manager that Alina is in the ICU after being beaten badly. McCall goes there and sees Alina's face even more bruised and messed up. He also notices she is with another girl, Mandy (Haley Bennett) who's crying uncontrollably. Robert doesn't go into the room but observes from a distance, unseen by the girls. Mandy later walks by McCall, crying. She gets a cup of coffee but overflows the cup. McCall comforts her and asks about Alina, explaining he's a friend. Mandy reveals that Slavi hit Alina and she hit him back. Slavi got mad and made an example out of her. Mandy says that Slavi also threw battery acid in a girl's face once and keeps her around as a reminder not to cross him. He treats his girls like merchandise and nothing more.McCall ponders on the situation for a few days before finally deciding to act. Using the card Slavi gave him, McCall goes to a restaurant where Slavi and his men are hanging out. McCall enters the office suite above the restaurant with an envelope containing $9800 which he offers for Alina's freedom. The goons laugh at McCall and Slavi explains that he makes so much money off of Alina being so young that $9800 could only buy her one month of freedom. He then laughs at McCall's offer and suggests he should go home and jerk off 9800 times. Then, maybe, Alina wouldn't be worth so much and he could consider freeing her. McCall takes the money back and starts to walk out. He almost leaves but then decides to stay and locks the door. After carefully observing the men and whatever weapons they may be holding, he sets the timer on his watch and moves into action. One of the men aims his gun at McCall, but he grabs the man's arm and causes him to shoot Slavi in the throat. He then jabs a shot glass into that man's eye. He stabs the third man with his own knife, and then gets a corkscrew and repeatedly stabs Tevi until he sticks it under his chin and finishes him off. McCall goes to Slavi's side and explains to him what his body is going through and that he'll be dead in a few seconds. Slavi asks \"Who are you?,\" to which McCall doesn't answer and counts down the remaining seconds before Slavi loses consciousness and dies. Robert apologizes and goes home where he cleans himself up and actually sleeps all night for once.Following the murders, a Russian mobster named Teddy (Marton Csokas) arrives in Boston to investigate what happened to Slavi and his men. He teams up with a group of corrupt cops to gain leads. So far, everything points to a gang hit from a rival mob.At work, McCall notices Ralphie isn't in. He's told by a manager that Ralphie called in quits. McCall visits a restaurant that Ralphie's mother (Luz Mery Sanchez (as Luz Sanchez)) owns. Ralphie is helping her after a fire broke out, supposedly by accident.Meanwhile, Teddy is taken by one of the crooked cops, Frank Masters (David Harbour), to the workplace of a gangster named John Looney (Shawn Fitzgibbon), to continue his search for the killer. John insults Teddy, and all Russians in general. In response, Teddy hits John with an ashtray while Frank kills John's goons. Teddy continues to beat John's face in until the man goes unconscious.The other two dirty cops, Remar (Mike O'Dea (as Mike P. O'Dea)) and Pederson (James Wilcox), are eating at Ralphie's mother's restaurant. They extort her for protection money and claim that there will be another \"accident\" if the money isn't on time again next week. McCall finds them outside the restaurant and says he'd like to report a crime. They brush him off and tell him to call 911 until he calls one of them on his personal cell phone. McCall plays a video he took of them extorting a convenience store clerk during which they confess to starting the fire at the restaurant. McCall tells them they can either give the money back or the video will hit the news stations. The cops hold him at gunpoint, but McCall quickly beats them both. They comply and later return the money to Ralphie's mother.Soon after, McCall is seen playing baseball with his co-workers when Ralphie shows up in a security guard uniform, having passed his test.Back at work, Robert goes to see Jenny (Anastasia Mousis Sanidopoulos (as Anastasia Mousis)), a cashier, for a refund when he notices she's dealing with a man silently committing a robbery at gunpoint. McCall calmly comes over and gives him the money. The crook also demands Jenny's ring, which was her mother's. She tearfully hands it to him. McCall observes several details of the man, like his tattoos and his clothes. He considers making a move but doesn't since children are entering the store and could get harmed in the process. McCall instead follows the man outside and gets a good look at the car plates on his ride. The cops inform them that this was part of a string of robberies from the same man. McCall then goes to get a sledgehammer off a rack. The next day, Jenny finds her ring in the register and McCall is seen returning the sledgehammer to the rack after wiping it clean.Meanwhile, Teddy finds out about Alina missing from Slavi's girls and questions Mandy who says she didn't really know her that well. He later visits Mandy and intimidates her into revealing that she lied. He makes her talk about the night she visited Alina at the hospital and she talks about an unknown but kind black man who also came by and inquired about Alina although she never found out who he was. Teddy then strangles her to death for lying to him.With that new information in mind, Teddy finds video evidence of McCall going into the restaurant but none of him ever leaving. Pretending to be a detective, he visits McCall at his apartment who sees through him right away but still answers his questions with his prepared answers. Teddy leaves feeling McCall is a lot more than he lets on.Teddy obtains some more information about McCall, but what they can find about him shows a clean record with no trace that he has any involvement with Slavi's death. Teddy gets the feeling that everything they know about McCall is just made-up information. He and Frank, along with another villain, wait outside in a car while another guy enters the diner where McCall is eating. McCall makes up the man right away and asks him if they're waiting for anyone else. The man pulls out a gun and walks over to him. A truck pulls up in front of the diner, obscuring Teddy's view from his vehicle. McCall hits the man in the stomach with his book and then kills him by slamming his head down on the table and breaking his neck. He then kills the lights by sticking a knife in an outlet. He walks out of the diner and snaps photos of Teddy and his men in their car with his cell phone before walking away.Knowing where he lives, the gangsters follow McCall home. He boils some honey to tend to a wound sustained from the gunman while the gangsters silently enter his home. They burst into his apartment only to reveal that McCall is actually in another apartment, watching them with hidden cameras.

While she is out gathering information, Brian and McCall talk about McCall's car bomb accident that had everyone, including Brian and Susan, believe Robert was dead. Brian mentions that somehow, Susan knew Robert wasn't truly dead. When she returns, she tells McCall that the men he killed were part of the Russian mafia led by Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich). Teddy, who is really named Nicolai, is the man Pushkin sends when something needs to be dealt with in no uncertain fashion.

Robert leaves the next morning after getting Susan's blessing to be the man he once was to finish what he started.McCall finds Frank Masters and traps him in his car, which he has rigged with a hose from the tailpipe. He tells Frank he better give him useful information about Pushkin's operations or he'll leave him in the car to die. Frank finally relents and takes McCall to a warehouse where the Russians count and stash huge pallets full of money, obviously millions of dollars in cash. McCall forcibly persuades the gangsters to surrender. He ties them up in a room with all the money for the cops to find. He then frees all the workers and gives them a departing bonus from Pushkin's money. He handcuffs Frank to a pole and tells him to call in a report. He then persuades Frank to be a good cop one last time and give him the information he knows Frank has probably stashed somewhere in case he ever needed leverage on Pushkin.

A few moments later, McCall sits in front of Teddy and drops the bloody sunglasses from the team leader letting Teddy know he won't come back. The two have a conversation in which Robert tells Teddy that he knows exactly who Teddy is and offers him a chance to stop everything before Robert finishes the job and takes out the entire organization. Teddy refuses the offer and arrogantly lets Robert know that he truly doesn't matter to him. Robert leaves the table after implying that he's not afraid to keep going. Teddy gets a call from Pushkin but he ignores it.Teddy finds a picture of Robert coming out of work with Ralphie and finally feels he has found a pressure point on McCall.

Teddy asks \"Who are you?\" to which McCall doesn't answer and watches him die. He then leaves the store.Three days later, McCall shows up in Pushkin's bathroom while he's showering in his Moscow home.
