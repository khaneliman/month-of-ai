    "A girl gifted with a keen intellect and psychic powers uses both to deal with her crude, distant family and free her kind teacher from their sadistic headmistress.",
    "Matilda Wormwood is an exquisite and intelligent little girl. Unfortunately, her parents, Harry and Zinnia misunderstand her because they think she is so different. As time passes, she finally starts school and has a kind teacher, loyal friends, and a sadistic headmistress. As she gets fed up with the constant cruelty, she begins to realize that she has a gift of telekinetic powers. After some days of practice, she suddenly turns the tables to stand up to Harry and Zinnia and outwit the headmistress.—Blazer346",
    "Sweet and bright little Matilda Wormwood, a child of wondrous intelligence, is different from the rest of her family. Misunderstood by everyone and ignored at home, she escapes into a world of reading, honing her skills, and exercising her mind so much that she develops telekinetic powers. When she is sent off to the Crunchem Hall Elementary School headed by the cruel, hulking headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, Matilda needs all the help she can get. But amid darkness, Matilda finds a single light in warm-hearted Miss Jennifer Honey, her first-grade teacher, who recognizes her remarkable skills--including a very distinctive talent that allows her to turn the tables on the wicked adults in her world. Will they ever see how extraordinary she is?—Nick Riganas",
    "A young female who is part of a mean family is allowed to attend a school. Instantly, she becomes friends with her peers and her teacher, who has a horrific past with the principal, who is viciously mean and treats children in an awful and terrible way.—RECB3",
    "A grouchy couple named Harry and Zinnia Wormwood are parents to a very sweet 6-year-old daughter named Matilda. Unlike them and her bratty brother, Michael, she becomes a very sweet and extremely intelligent girl who can't wait to go to school and read books. After a while, Harry and Zinnia send her to the school with the worst headmistress in the world, a very sweet teacher, and good friends. While trying to put up with her parents' and headmistress' cruelty, she starts to unwittingly unleash telekinetic powers, destroying a television and making a newt fly onto the headmistress. With enough practice, she learns to control her telekinetic powers and is soon using them on the headmistress so she can drive her away from the school.—anonomys"
