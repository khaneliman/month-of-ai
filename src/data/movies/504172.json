    "A ninety-year-old horticulturist and Korean War veteran turns drug mule for a Mexican cartel.",
    "Clint Eastwood stars as Earl Stone, a man who is ninety years old, broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive. Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel. He does well, so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler. But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl. The mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging D.E.A. Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper). And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him.",
    "In Peoria, Illinois, Korean War veteran Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is a ninety-year-old horticulturist that has always prioritized his work and friends over his family. He is estranged by his ex-wife Mary (Dianne Wiest) and his daughter Iris (Alison Eastwood). When his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga) is celebrating her engagement with her fiancé, Earl is completely broke, and agrees to become a mule above any suspicion for the Mexican cartel, transporting drugs under the alias of \"Tata\". He makes money and resolves many financial issues of his family and friends. Meanwhile, efficient D.E.A. Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) is in charge of investigating the notorious cartel and the mysterious Tata with his partner Agent Treviño (Michael Peña).—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
    "Due to financial problems, an 80-something-year-old man, Earl Stone, takes a job as a drug mule, driving shipments between Texas and Illinois for a Mexican cartel. Unbeknownst to him, the DEA are targeting the cartel, resulting in Earl being the central figure in their investigations.—grantss",
    "Illinois celebrated lily grower Earl Stone (73) wins horticulture prizes, but is too broke to afford a nice gift for his daughter Iris's wedding, where he even arrives late, grimly scolded by mother Mary who divorced him. 13 years of Internet competition later, he's so broke he can't keep his home. So a vague family friend's offer to earn a pack of banknotes by transporting a closed bag from Texas to Illinois in his trusted rickety truck and home is irresistible, so becomes his lucrative job, and he starts spreading the proceeds to family and veteran buddies. The DEA, using blackmail, and rivalry within the Mexican drug cartel that exploits the mule draw him and kin into a dirty game with many losers.—KGF Vissers"
