    "An Oxford graduate takes up a job in a mental asylum, only to discover that the \"revolutionary\" new treatments are inhumane, and that there is more going on than meets the eye.",
    "A couple of days before 1899 Christmas, the Oxford new graduate Dr. Edward Newgate arrives at the Stonehearst Asylum to complete training for his specialty of asylum medicine. He is met by armed men who take him to Dr. Silas Lamb, who welcomes his help and takes him under his wing. Edward is shocked to see the methods that Dr. Lamb uses to run this asylum. He becomes infatuated with Eliza Graves, one of the patients who is a lady of status and does not seem to belong. One night, Edward overhears a knocking from the bowels of the facility and is shocked to find that everything is not as it seems in this place and that his uneasy feelings may be justified. What will Edward Choose?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
    "In hope of becoming a resident and in search of experience, Edward Newgate, a promising young doctor who has recently graduated from Oxford, arrives at the Stonehearst institution for the mentally ill, in 1899. However, right from the start, it is quite clear that the superintendent Dr. Silas Lamb's unorthodox methods of treatment seem to have no positive effect on the patients, furthermore, there is a strange feeling that there is more to the asylum than meets the eye. Little by little, as Edward becomes infatuated with the mysteriously alluring inmate, Eliza Graves, reconciling Lamb's practices with his fresh ideas about therapy, will soon lead to a startling and unexpected discovery. In the end, who can be trusted in a place where nothing is as it seems?—Nick Riganas"
