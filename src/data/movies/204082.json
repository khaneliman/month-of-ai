He is recently widowed and is left with a 9 year old daughter, Maddy. He decides to quit the turbulent and demanding life of the DEA for Maddy's sake and retires to a small town.

    "Two years after the raids of a gang's methamphetamine laboratory where his cover was blown, former DEA Agent and U.S. war veteran, Phil Broker (Jason Statham) and his daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) have moved to a small Louisiana town where Maddy's deceased mother grew up. Maddy gets into a schoolyard fight with a bully named Teddy Klum; when Broker comes to the school, Teddy's hostile father, Jimmy (Marcus Hester), picks a fight with him and loses. Cassie Klum (Kate Bosworth) later asks her brother, a drug dealer named Gator Bodine (James Franco), to scare Broker. Broker fights off a few of Gator's thugs at a gas station when they threaten him. While he and Maddy later go horse riding, Gator breaks into their house. He deduces from old personnel files that Broker was the undercover cop responsible for the arrest of Danny T (Chuck Zito) in the raid two years earlier. Hoping to get a wider distribution for the drugs he manufactures, Gator tips off Danny T, who sends members of his gang to kill Broker..",
    "Yearning to start afresh and to disappear with his ten-year-old daughter, Maddy, the former DEA agent, Phil Broker, relocates to Louisiana's warm backwoods. However, Phil will soon find himself neck-deep into trouble, when a violent incident at Maddy's school paves the way for a head-on confrontation with the local crystal meth dealer, Gator, and his cut-throat henchmen. Now, Gator knows of Broker's well-hidden past--and as Phil tries to stay out of trouble--the ruthless drug lord will stop at nothing to get him out of the way, including putting in harm's way the innocent Maddy. Will Broker and his daughter get their lives back?â€”Nick Riganas",
    "Undercover DEA Agent (and U.S. war veteran) Phil Broker flees after the big city drug lord whose methamphetamine laboratory he got blown up swore vengeance for the death during arrest of his reckless son 'Danny T' Turrie. Two years he lives a quiet witness protection life as mechanic in a Louisiana small town. Phil only gets noticed after his preteen brat daughter Maddie beats up class bully Teddy Klum, whose measly father Jimmy forces Phil to a fight which only humiliates the Klums further. So his wife Cassie Bodine Klum turns to her brother Morgan 'Gator' Bodine, who firmly and violently rules the local drug scene -even beating up teens- but finds his goons beaten up by Broker at a gas station. Gator stumbled onto Phil's past and sends his girl back to the city, seeking a lucrative deal with the Turrie gang, but that gets bloodily out of anyone's control.â€”KGF Vissers"
