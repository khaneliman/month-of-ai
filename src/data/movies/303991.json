    "A successful investment banker struggles after losing his wife in a tragic car crash. With the help of a customer service rep and her young son, he starts to rebuild, beginning with the demolition of the life he once knew.",
    "Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal), a successful private equity fund partner, struggles after losing his wife in a tragic car crash. Despite pressure from his father-in-law, Phil (Chris Cooper), to pull it together, Davis continues to unravel. What starts as a complaint letter to a vending machine company turns into a series of letters revealing startling personal admissions. Davis' letters catch the attention of customer service rep, Karen (Naomi Watts), and, amidst emotional and financial burdens of her own, the two form an unlikely connection. With the help of Karen and her son Chris (Judah Lewis), Davis starts to rebuild, beginning with the demolition of the life he once knew.—Fox Searchlight",
    "Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) has a comfortable life as a Wall Street investment banker, but it's brought to an abrupt halt when his wife is killed in a car accident. As he struggles to move on from this tragedy, he reflects on the stagnant marriage he had with his late spouse. He also becomes obsessed with dismantling the machines surrounding him as a coping mechanism, and begins a relationship with a customer-service representative for a vending-machine company (Naomi Watts) after sending them multiple complaint letters."
