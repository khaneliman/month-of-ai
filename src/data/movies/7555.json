    "In Thailand, John Rambo joins a group of mercenaries to venture into war-torn Burma, and rescue a group of Christian aid workers who were kidnapped by the ruthless local infantry unit.",
    "Vietnam veteran John Rambo has survived many harrowing ordeals in his lifetime and has since withdrawn into a simple and secluded existence in Thailand, where he spends his time capturing snakes for local entertainers, and chauffeuring locals in his old PT boat. Even though he is looking to avoid trouble, trouble has a way of finding him: a group of Christian human rights missionaries, led by Michael Burnett and Sarah Miller, approach Rambo with the desire to rent his boat to travel up the river to Burma. For over fifty years, Burma has been a war zone. The Karen people of the region, who consist of peasants and farmers, have endured brutally oppressive rule from the murderous Burmese military and have been struggling for survival every single day. After some inner contemplation, Rambo accepts the offer and takes Michael, Sarah, and the rest of the missionaries up the river. When the missionaries finally arrive at the Karen village, they find themselves part of a raid by the sadistic Major Pa Tee Tint and a slew of Burmese army men. A portion of the villagers and missionaries are tortured and viciously murdered, while Tint and his men hold the remainder captive. Concerned by their disappearance, the minister in charge of the mission gathers a group of mercenaries and pleas Rambo transport them with his boat, since he knows their last exact location. But Rambo can't stay behind: he joins the team where he belongs, to liberate the survivors from the clutches of Major Tint in what may be one of his deadliest missions everâ€”stallonezone.com / Drew Lahat",
    "In this latest Rambo installment, John Rambo has retreated to a simple life in a rural Thai village near the Burmese border, capturing snakes for local entertainers, and transporting roamers in his old PT boat. Following repeated pleas, Rambo helps ferry a group of Christian aid workers into war-torn Burma, where the local Karen villagers are regularly tortured and massacred by Major Tint's sadistic soldiers. The humanitarian mission is going well, until the village is attacked and the missionaries are kidnapped, and Rambo is once again asked to transport - but this time a group of mercenaries, assembled by the missionaries' minister on a deadly rescue mission. This time he doesn't stay behind.â€”Drew Lahat",
    "In Thailand, John Rambo is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat. When a group of Christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in Burma to help the locals, the reluctant Rambo only accepts when Sarah Miller presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission. Rambo leaves the group in the requested location, but the village where they are working is attacked by the sadistic army of Major Pa Tee Tint, the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted. Later a member of their church meets Rambo and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",

  "synopsis": "Amid the political protests of the Saffron Revolution in Burma, ruthless SPDC officer Major Pa Tee Tint (Maung Maung Khin) leads Burmese junta army forces to pillage small villages (of the Karen ethnic community) in a campaign of fear. His soldiers sadistically slaughter innocents, abduct teenage boys to be drafted into his army and hold women hostage to be assaulted as sex slaves.Meanwhile, 20 years after the events in Afghanistan, Vietnam War veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is still living in Thailand, making a meager living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides. A missionary doctor from Colorado named Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze) hires Rambo to use his boat to ferry their group up the Salween River into Burma on a humanitarian mission to provide medical aid to a village inhabited by the Karen people. Rambo initially refuses, then agrees when requested by Michael's fiance Sarah Miller (Julie Benz).During the trip, the boat is stopped by pirates demanding Sarah in exchange for passage, forcing Rambo to kill them. Greatly disturbed by Rambo's actions, Michael sends him back upon arriving at their destination, claiming his group no longer wants his help. In the village, the missionaries provide aid to those attacked by Tint's soldiers. But the army strikes, the villagers are massacred and the missionaries are abducted.\nOn his way back, Rambo destroys the pirate boat by setting fire to it, but eventually gets back to the village.The pastor of the missionaries' church comes to Thailand and asks Rambo to guide a team of five foreign mercenaries on a rescue mission. Rambo takes the mercenary team to the drop-off point and offers to help, but Lewis (Graham McTavish), a former SAS soldier and the team's leader, refuses. Myint (Supakorn Kitsuwon), a Karen rebel familiar with the area, leads the mercenaries to the village of the massacre. As they survey the damage, a squad of Tint's soldiers arrive in a cargo truck with a group of villagers, intent on playing games and killing them.Outnumbered, the mercenaries take cover and watch helplessly as the soldiers prey on their hostages. Having secretly followed the mercenaries, Rambo emerges in time to kill all the soldiers with his bow and arrow, allowing the hostages to escape unharmed. Rambo joins the mercenary team and they make their way to Tint's soldiers' camp. They stealthily rescue the surviving American missionaries and Burmese hostages and flee under cover of night.The next morning, Tint and his soldiers pursue them. Rambo lures a section of the army into activating a dormant British Tallboy bomb left lying in the forest, killing his targets. Eventually, Tint's soldiers manage to capture everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy (Matthew Marsden), the mercenaries' sniper.\nBefore Tint can execute the mercenaries, Rambo launches a surprise attack by seizing a jeep mounted with an M2 Browning machine gun, igniting a massive firefight in the jungle during which he shoots most of Tint's army dead while the mercenaries engage Tint's soldiers. The Karen rebels, led by Myint, arrive and join the fight, helping to overwhelm Tint's soldiers and kill them all. After realizing his defeat, Tint attempts to escape, but Rambo intercepts and disembowels him dead with his machete.\nSometime later, Rambo returns to the United States to visit his father at his home in Bowie, Arizona.",
