    "After a remote diamond mine collapses in the far northern regions of Canada, an ice driver leads an impossible rescue mission over a frozen ocean to save the lives of trapped miners despite thawing waters and a threat they never see coming.",
    "After the sudden collapse of tunnel six in the Katka Mine of Canada's Manitoba, killing eight miners and leaving twenty-six more unaccounted for, it falls to the seasoned big-rig driver, Mike McCann, to deliver a vital, 30-ton, 18-foot gas well-head and 300 feet of pipe up there in under 30 hours. Composed of Mike's aphasia-stricken brother, Gurty, the veteran truck driver, Jim Goldenrod, and Jim's brilliant ex-employee, Tantoo, the hand-picked team has to brave the elements and travel across the thin ice road of a frozen lake in April that can shatter to pieces at any moment. However, neither the ice cracking under their wheels nor the arctic blizzards can compare with the challenges that await the drivers ahead. Can the truckers make it to the mine in time?—Nick Riganas",
    "When a diamond mine collapses in Canada due to a methane explosion, a team of miners are trapped inside and the rescue team cannot use explosives since there is methane inside. The company tries to contract truck drives to bring the necessary rescue equipment in less than thirty hours since this is the maximum time that the miners can survive. They hire the experienced Mike McCann and his mechanic brother Gurty McCann; the Indian Tantoo; and the chief of the drivers Jim Goldenrod to drive three trucks and have redundancy in case of any accident. They also promise a two-hundred-dollar payment to be shared among the survivors and send the actuary Tom Varnay with them in Tantoo's truck. When Jim's engine blows-up and the truck sinks in the ice road with him, Varnay convinces the brothers that Tantoo has sabotaged the engine and they tie her up in her cabin. But soon Mike and Gurty learn that Tantoo is innocent and Varnay has a hidden agenda and they have to fight to survive along their journey through the ice road.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"

  "synopsis": "An explosion at a mine in Manitoba traps 26 miners. Mike McCann and his brother Gurty, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD and aphasia, work for a trucking company in North Dakota until Mike punches another trucker for referring to Gurty as a \"retard\", and they are both fired. Mike hears about ice road truckers needed in Winnipeg, and they apply. Jim Goldenrod, another trucker, agrees to lead a rescue mission to deliver wellheads to the mine. He hires McCann and Gurty, along with a young woman, Tantoo. Also joining is actuary Varnay, responsible for insurance risk assessment for Katka, the company which owns the mine. $200,000 is split between the four truckers, which will be redistributed among the survivors if anyone dies. Meanwhile, the miners are communicating with Katka executives, and Katka General Manager Sickle transmits a message that they plan to free the men by blasting a tunnel.The team leaves for the mine with three wellheads. During the trip, Goldenrod's engine seizes. While attempting to repair it, the ice beneath his trailer breaks and his leg gets trapped. Knowing he can't escape, he convinces Tantoo to sever the strap attaching him to the truck, causing him to drown but saving the other two rigs and wellheads. In an attempt to flee the rapidly approaching pressure wave and cracking ice, the remaining two trucks fishtail and roll over, stopping the pressure wave.Varnay convinces Mike to accuse Tantoo of sabotaging Goldenrod's rig, but Tantoo reveals her brother Cody is amongst the miners. When they continue to interrogate her, she pulls out a pistol, but Gurty disarms her and ties her up. After the men right the trucks, Varnay locks Mike and Gurty in the back of their rig. Varnay is revealed to have been the one who sabotaged Goldenrod's rig, and knocks Tantoo unconscious. He rigs Mike's truck with dynamite and drives off with Tantoo, but Mike and Gurty escape from the trailer and throw the dynamite away just before it explodes. Varnay watches the explosion from afar, believing that Mike and Gurty are dead.While winching their trailer out of the ice, Gurty tries to warn Mike the winch will fail, but Mike starts the machine anyway. The winch snaps, causing Gurty and the trailer to fall into the water, but Mike rescues Gurty. Varnay meets with Sickle, telling him Mike and Gurty have died. Sickle instructs Varnay to get rid of Tantoo and the last remaining wellhead by making it seem Tantoo lost control and veered off a cliff. Varnay prepares to kill Tantoo, but is bitten by Gurty's pet rat Skeeter, enabling Tantoo to throw him out of the rig. Mike and Gurty arrive and kill the Katka contractors pursuing Tantoo.After Tantoo runs out of fuel due to Varnay disconnecting her fuel equalizer, he catches up to her, but Mike crashes his rig into Varnay's truck, sending it off a cliff. Varnay survives and creates an avalanche with dynamite. Mike and Gurty escape, but Tantoo is hit by snow and wounded by a branch. They uncouple her trailer, and drive off with the wellhead. Varnay pursues them in Tantoo's rig and begins ramming them. Mike boards Varnay's rig and both fall from the truck. After a struggle, Mike attempts to drive away, but Varnay climbs onto the rig. Mike knocks Varnay out, accelerates the rig, and jumps out, causing it to fall through the surface and kill Varnay. Meanwhile, Tantoo and Gurty cross a bridge not designed for the weight of the truck, and barely make it over before the bridge collapses. After crossing, the truck starts sliding backwards, and Gurty is crushed trying to prevent the truck from falling. Mike arrives and comforts a dying Gurty. Mike and Tantoo arrive just in time to rescue the miners. After learning the truth, the Katka CEO fires Sickle, who is arrested for his actions.Three months later, Tantoo is seen working in Goldenrod's garage as a mechanic. Mike visits her in his new gold truck, which he drives as an independent contractor to deliver sporting goods. As he drives off, he is seen tending to Skeeter and his license plate reads \"TRK TRK TRK\", in honor of Gurty's chosen name for a truck. (copied from Wikipedia)",
