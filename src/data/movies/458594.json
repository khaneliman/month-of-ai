    "Five years after her husband and daughter are killed in a senseless act of violence, a woman comes back from self-imposed exile to seek revenge against those responsible and the system that let them go free.",
    "An unidentified woman is engaged in a brutal fight with a man in a car and finally dispatches him with a shot to the head. Five years earlier, the same woman, Riley North, is working as a bank teller in Los Angeles struggling to make ends meet. Her husband Chris owns a failing mechanic shop. They have a ten-year-old daughter, Carly. Chris' friend tries to talk him into robbing Diego Garcia, a powerful drug lord. Chris turns him down, but not before Garcia has already discovered his involvement and ordered his men to make an example of him. Riley and Chris take Carly out for pizza and to a carnival for her birthday since no one showed up to her party. At the carnival, Carly orders peppermint ice cream. As the family walks to the car, Diego's men gun down her husband and daughter in a drive-by shooting. She is wounded, but survives.",
    "Five long years earlier, the former Los Angeles bank teller, Riley North, was a doting mother of one, living a hand-to-mouth existence with her husband, Chris, and their ten-year-old daughter, Carly. Then, Chris, after toying with the dangerous idea of upgrading their lives, caught the eye of the pitiless local drug lord, Diego Garcia, and his murderous henchmen, who decided to make an example of him. Half a decade later, with her family decimated and the remorseless perpetrators allowed to get off scot-free, a now-off-the-grid Riley has re-emerged as a perfectly honed one-woman killing machine, bent on revenge and murder. Now, they all have to pay, and as the dauntless female avenging angel spills the blood of the wicked, no one is safe; not even the corrupt puppets of the ineffective justice system. However, can violence ever be justified?âNick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "The film opens with what appears to be a struggle happening in a car. Riley North (Jennifer Garner) is fighting a gangster who slashes her leg with his knife. She gains the upper hand and holds a gun under his chin. Riley asks if he remembers her, but he simply responds with a defiant \"Fuck you!\" before Riley blows his brains out.Riley goes to an impoverished neighborhood where she hides out. She enters her van where she tends to her leg wound and has a drink. She goes through her belongings, and out falls a box of girl scout cookies.Five years earlier.....Riley is seen with her daughter Carly (Cailey Fleming) after getting into an argument with another girl scout's mother, Peg (Pell James), who complains to Riley that they were selling on their turf. Later, Riley and Carly stop to visit Riley's husband/Carly's father Chris (Jeff Hephner), who, unbeknownst to Riley, is arranging some kind of shady deal with his co-worker Mickey (Chris Johnson). Riley then goes to work at her bank and is told to close even though it's Carly's birthday.Riley goes home for Carly's birthday party, only to find her and Chris disappointed because nobody showed up thanks to Peg, who spitefully threw a holiday party and invited all the other kids, but left a voicemail just to taunt Riley and Carly. Riley decides not to let Carly stay sad, so she suggests they all go to the Christmas carnival. As they head out, Chris calls Mickey to tell him he's backing out of the deal. The family leaves, and they are watched by a gangbanger. He calls his boss, cartel leader Diego Garcia (Juan Pablo Raba). Garcia is in the middle of torturing Mickey, who was apparently trying to steal from Garcia with Chris's help. Garcia orders his guy to follow Chris right before he decapitates Mickey.The Norths enjoy their evening at the carnival and end the night with ice cream. As Chris and Carly walk back toward the car, three gangbangers drive up by them and shoot them. Riley gets shot as well, but she manages to make it to the bodies of her husband and daughter.Riley wakes up in the hospital and meets with Detective Stan Carmichael (John Gallagher Jr).

He also notices some medication that Riley is taking, but she forces him out of her house.Riley is brought in to testify against the gangbangers, but Henderson tries to use the medication thing against her by saying her memory was hazy or that she is mentally unfit to remember them.

After the trial, Riley robbed her bank and stole military-grade guns from a warehouse before going off the grid. Carmichael then gets a phone call telling him about Stevens' death, as well as the fact that Henderson was found face down in his pool.
