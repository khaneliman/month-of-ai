    "After being coerced into working for a crime boss, a young getaway driver finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail.",
    "Baby is a young and partially hearing impaired getaway driver who can make any wild move while in motion with the right track playing. It's a critical talent he needs to survive his indentured servitude to the crime boss, Doc, who values his role in his meticulously planned robberies. However, just when Baby thinks he is finally free and clear to have his own life with his new girlfriend, Debora, Doc coerces him back for another job. Now saddled with a crew of thugs too violently unstable to keep to Doc's plans, Baby finds himself and everything he cares for in terrible danger. To survive and escape the coming maelstrom, it will take all of Baby's skill, wits and daring, but even on the best track, can he make it when life is forcing him to face the music?‚ÄîKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)",
    "Baby is a young getaway driver, contracted to a master-criminal, Doc. Doc's specialty is armed robberies - he puts together teams for each heist, with Baby being the only constant. Baby completes his last job for Doc and is now free. He sets about leading a normal life, getting a legitimate job and starting a relationship (with Debora). However, Doc views Baby as a sort of good luck charm, and, using threats of violence, pulls him back into the criminal world. With a particular job in mind, Doc assembles his team. However, the other individuals are incompatible with each other, if not psychotic, and soon not only is Baby's life at risk but also Debora's.‚Äîgrantss",
    "Indebted to Doc, the icy Atlanta crime lord, Baby, the youthful, talented, but hesitant getaway driver, for years now, has been the constant unstoppable force behind the kingpin's masterfully-planned daring heists. Always in sync with his carefully-chosen playlists, whether he's burning rubber or strolling down the street, Baby needs just one more job to get off the hook--and maybe--even go out on a proper date with the charming waitress, Debora. Caught up in the bliss of a whirlwind romance, Baby desperately wants out; however, as things get out of hand, will the young designated driver be able to protect those he loves?‚ÄîNick Riganas",
    "Baby is a young getaway driver living in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was a child a car accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus which he blocks out by listening to music on his iPod. He ferries crews of robbers led by a criminal mastermind named Doc in order to pay off a debt he incurred after stealing one of Doc's cars. Between jobs, he creates remixes from snippets of conversations he records and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. While waiting for his next job Baby meets a young waitress named Debora; the pair quickly bond over their interests in music and fall in love.."

  "synopsis": "When Baby (Ansel Elgort) was a child, a car accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus (continuos humming sounds in the ears), which he blocks out by listening to music on iPods. As a teen, Baby lived a troubled life and it is revealed that he once tried to steal a car which was, unknown to him, owned by criminal mastermind \"Doc\" (Kevin Spacey). Baby was caught by Doc himself but instead being turned in, he was coerced to work for Doc to pay off the debt. As a result, he became a getaway driver and ferried crews of robbers assembled by Doc. Between jobs, he creates remixes from snippets of conversations he records, and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph (CJ Jones). At a diner, he meets a waitress, Debora (Lily James), and they start dating.Baby's supposedly final job for Doc goes awry after the trigger-happy Bats (Jamie Foxx), who developed an immediate dislike to Baby, shoots a security guard. It becomes worse when an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime. Joseph persuades him to start fresh and become a pizza delivery driver while Baby continues to date Deborah. However, while Baby is on a fancy dinner date with Debora, Doc appears and insists that he join another heist's crew, threatening to hurt Debora if he refuses.
