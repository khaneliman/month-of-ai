    "In the sequel to 2018's The Kissing Booth', high school senior Elle juggles a long-distance relationship with her dreamy boyfriend Noah, college applications, and a new friendship with a handsome classmate that could change everything.",
    "Elle Evans (Joey King) just had the most romantic summer of her life with her reformed bad-boy boyfriend Noah Flynn (Jacob Elordi). But now Noah's off to Harvard, and Elle's headed back to high school for her senior year. She'll have to juggle a long-distance relationship, getting into her dream college with her best friend Lee (Joel Courtney), and a new friendship with handsome classmate Marco (Taylor Perez). When Noah grows close to a seemingly-perfect college girl, Elle will have to decide how much she trusts him, and just what - and who - her heart truly wants. Director and screenwriter Vince Marcello returns for THE KISSING BOOTH sequel, based on characters from Beth Reekles' 2012 young adult book.—Netflix"
  ],
  "synopsis": "The film starts with Elle (Joey King) narrating her time with Noah (Jacob Elordi) before he leaves for Harvard. Her senior year begins with her classmates gossiping about how she and Noah will eventually break up, making her fear elevate as Noah has befriended an attractive British girl named Chloe (Maisie Richardson-Sellers) on Instagram. Meanwhile Noah is insecure that Elle is ignoring him (she was giving him space) and calls her up to say that she should be close to him. Noah suggests Elle apply to Harvard, which clashes with her plans to study at University of California, Berkeley with Lee (where their moms met and became friends). Elle does it without telling Lee.Elle and Lee (Joel Courtney) (Noah's brother) are planning the kissing booth again for the Charity Fair, while Lee is trying to convince Elle to have Marco Peña (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the attractive new transfer student, also known as the new \"Noah Flynn,\" be one of the kissers. One of the girls tricks Elle into salivating all over Marco's exercising video, while the school mic was on. Marco later teases Elle about it and Marco's team beats Elle at the school's athletic games. Lee and Elle are proud of their high score at the dancing game at the arcade. Lately, the high score has been replaced by someone named \"MVP\". Turns out MVP is Marco.\nElle beats Marco on the dancing game, forcing him to participate in the booth.Elle visits Noah in Boston, meeting his new friends and Chloe, making her more insecure. Elle attends her college interviews, and one interviewer tells her that Elle should not worry about who she is supposed to be and would be far more interesting if she was just being herself.\nShe finds an earring below Noah's bed, making her angry and confronting Noah, who assures her nothing has happened between him and Chloe and asking her to trust him. Elle talks with her father about college tuition and learns money is a problem and is willing to participate with Lee in a dance competition with a cash reward (for $50K) for first place. Lee has an accident on one of their practice sessions (later revealed to be fake) and proposes that Marco become her dance partner, which she isn't too happy to accept but eventually does. As Marco and Elle start passing the time together, they grow closer, and an attraction between them initiates.\nMeanwhile Noah goes to a concert with Chloe, which Elle knew (as she called Noah that day, but his phone was in his room and his room-mate told Elle that Noah had gone with Chloe). But when Elle spoke to Noah the next day, he hides the fact that he went with Chloe.Unbeknownst to Elle, Lee's relationship with Rachel (Meganne Young) is having problems, as Elle is going everywhere with them and not letting them have their time as a couple. After leaving Rachel waiting at the movies, she asks Lee to talk with Elle, promising he will but never does.\nThe Halloween Dance arrives, and Lee forgets to tell Rachel that they changed costumes (Rachel was a marshmallow while Lee and Elle were going to be crackers making a Smore), upsetting her even more. Elle shares a dance with Marco, almost kissing him but stops upon hearing the OMG (Mia (Camilla Wolfson), Olivia (Bianca Bosch) and Gwyneth (Zandile Madliwa)) girls gossiping about her.On the day of the competition, Lee finds in his car trunk Elle's applications to Harvard, angering him. Elle and Marco excel at their performance, and she kisses him at the end of their dance, not knowing Noah was in the crowd, causing him to walk away. Elle wants to go after him the moment she and Marco are announced the winners.Thanksgiving dinner happens at Flynn's residence, where Noah arrives with Chloe, upsetting Elle, who Lee confronts for not telling him about her application to Harvard and Rachel being upset with her as well. During dinner, Rachel discovers Lee never spoke with Elle (about giving her and Lee the space and privacy) and leaves. Lee catches up with her, and Rachel breaks up with him. Elle tries to convince Rachel to reconcile with Lee but is unsuccessful. She also gives back the earring to Chloe, who confirms it belongs to her. She reveals to Noah in a bar that one night she slept in Noah's room when he was out and lost it.The carnival day arrives, and both Lee and Rachel reconcile after being blindfolded and kissing each other at the kissing booth. Elle is also blindfolded and is approached by Marco, who wants to talk with her about their feelings. Elle admits to Marco there is an attraction between them but tells him she loves Noah and goes looking for him at the airport (as they are both leaving that night). Chloe tells her that he went to look for her, and Elle finds him in the park where they first kissed. Noah confesses to being embarrassed that he wasn't doing as well at Harvard as he initially thought. He also wants a relationship with Chloe in the same way Elle has with Lee. Elle and Noah reunite.6-7 months later, Noah returns, and Elle, Lee, and Rachel graduate. Lee shares with Elle that he was accepted at Berkeley and asked if she received a response. She answers she was wait-listed at both Berkeley and Harvard. As Marco looks from afar at Elle, his friend notices and says she's not worth it, but Marco decides that she is. When Elle opens both envelopes in her room, it turns out she was accepted to both universities, which will force her to make a decision: go to Harvard with Noah or Berkeley with Lee.",
