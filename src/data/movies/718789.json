  "synopsis": "In 1995, a boy got a Buzz LightYear toy based on his favorite movie. This is that movie.\nA human spacecraft searches for habitable planets 4.3 M light years from Earth. When it detects a possible planet, the craft wakes up its commander from cryogenic sleep.\nBuzz Lightyear (Chris Evans), a Space Ranger in Star Command, alongside his commanding officer and best friend, Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba), explore the habitable planet, T'Kani Prime, with their new recruit, Featheringhamstan (Bill Hader). They are forced to retreat to their exploration vessel after discovering that the planet hosts hostile lifeforms. Buzz damages the vessel during the retreat (he takes off at the wrong angle (as the ship was tied down by vines coming out of the ground), thereby hitting the top of a nearby mountain during its ascent), forcing the crew to evacuate in order to conduct repairs and continue their journey. The hyperspace crystal of the ship is destroyed.One year later, the crew have constructed a nascent colony along with the necessary infrastructure to conduct repairs. They even manufacture a new hyperspace crystal, but it needs to be tested before it can be deployed. Buzz volunteers to test hyperspace fuel, a key component of the repairs. I.V.A.N. (Mary McDonald-Lewis), a voice-activated virtual assistant is Buzz's autopilot. However, after a four-minute test, he finds that four years have passed on T'Kani Prime, due to the effects of time dilation from having traveled at relativistic speeds. The test was a failure as the fuel was unstable and the ship failed to achieve hyperspace speeds. Buzz vows to continue testing the fuel mix until they perfect it to continue the mission.\nBuzz is introduced to Sox (Peter Sohn), a robotic feline who has been assigned to give him company after his long duration away from the colony, and continues testing the hyperspace fuel. To keep Sox busy, Buzz asks him to work on the fuel stability problem. With every test, four more years pass on T'Kani Prime, until eventually over 62 years have passed. During this time, the colony develops; Alisha raises a son with her wife Kiko, their son grows up, gets a promotion and gets married. Alisha subsequently dies of old age; and Sox improves the fuel's composition, allowing it to obtain faster-than-light speeds.Against the orders of his new commanding officer, Cal Burnside (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) (Cal informs Buzz that the colony has decided to build a laser shield to keep the critters out and that the current planet will be humanity's new home.. so, there is no need for hyperspace fuel anymore), Buzz uses this new fuel composition for a successful hyperspace test. But during the escape from the colony, Buzz breaks the computer with the formula, so the fuel sample in his hand is the only one left.\nUpon landing, Buzz discovers 22 years have passed, during which T'Kani Prime has been invaded by Zyclops robots led by the mysterious Zurg (James Brolin). Buzz meets up with members of the colony's defense forces, including Izzy Hawthorne (Keke Palmer), Alisha's now-adult granddaughter; Mo Morrison (Taika Waititi), a fresh, naive recruit; and Darby Steel (Dale Soules), an elderly paroled convict. While initially reluctant to work with them, Buzz eventually warms to them. Together, they plan to attack Zurg's ship and destroy the invading force.Izzy takes Buzz to an abandoned storage area where some of the old ships are kept. Buzz manages to steal a ship, but has to take the others with him when they are attacked by giant critters. On their way to space. the ship is attacked by Zurg, who manages to hit Buzz's ship and forces him to land on the dark side of the planet.\nThe attack damages the ship's capacitor coil, forcing the group to get one from an abandoned mine a few miles away. The Zurg tracks them down at the mine and attacks the group, but strangely only goes after Buzz. Buzz manages to escape, but the robots launched by Zurg manage to steal the hyperspace fuel sample from Buzz's ship.Following an encounter, Zurg abducts Buzz, bringing him aboard his ship where he reveals that he is an older version of him from an alternate time-line in which, after the successful hyperspace test, Burnside attempted to arrest him for stealing the craft and forced him to escape. Aided by the effects of time dilation, he traveled to the far future, encountering a technologically advanced and abandoned vessel. He assumed Zurg's identity by wearing his signature Mecha suit, and traveled to the now-present to obtain more hyperspace fuel from Buzz in order to travel further back in time and prevent the exploration vessel from landing on T'Kani Prime in the first place. However, Buzz refuses due to the implications of the possible temporal paradox that would result from such actions, which would wipe out the current time-line and everyone from it. Meanwhile, Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox board Zurg's ship to assist Buzz. After a chaotic assault on the ship, Buzz and his comrades-in-arms destroy the ship and escape.However, Zurg, having survived his ship's destruction, arrives and attacks Buzz, grabbing the hyperspace fuel. Buzz shoots the fuel, causing it to explode and incapacitate Zurg. With the fuel gone, Buzz wishes to stay on T'Kani Prime. Upon landing, Burnside arrests Buzz, but relents, allowing Buzz to revive the Space Ranger Corps. Buzz selects Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox to form the core of this organization, much to Burnside's surprise. Buzz and his team are then sent off to a new adventure in parts unknown. In a post-credits scene, a seemingly lifeless Zurg is floating in space when his eyes suddenly light up.",
