To defeat him, his only hope rests in the hands of a retired Batman, another Barry and an imprisoned kryptonian.",

    "Barry Allen has always been well-known as The Flash as he continues to juggle between civilian life and his superhero duties. However, in an attempt to save his mother from being killed, Barry travels back in time using his powers. However, whilst going back to his own universe, he is horrified to discover that he has created a timeline where superheroes are almost non-existent; this is made even worse when an alternate General Zod returns to try and destroy the world. Now with the help of an alternate and elderly Batman, an unfamiliar Kryptonian, and even his younger self from the past, Barry must stop Zod's evil plan and hopefully travel back through the space-time continuum in order to restore his universe back to the way it was.—Affan Jamsari"
