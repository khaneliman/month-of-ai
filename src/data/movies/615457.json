    "A docile family man slowly reveals his true character after his house gets burgled by two petty thieves, which, coincidentally, leads him into a bloody war with a Russian crime boss.",
    "Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life's indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody. When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)-and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.—Universal Pictures",
    "Trapped in a mundane existence, Hutch Mansell, a glum, humble, workaday suburban father, is petrified when violent burglars break into his home, threatening his wife and children. In the wake of this soul-scarring incident, one good deed and several broken bones--and teeth--later, suddenly, imperfect Hutch summons up the courage to stand up for himself, only to find himself targeted by the murderous Russian drug lord, Yulian Kuznetsov, and his brutal henchmen. It seems that Mansell has a death wish; however, in this world, there are two kinds of people: wolves and lambs. The question is, which one is Hutch?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) leads an ordinary life with a strained marriage to Becca (Connie Nielsen), two children Blake (Gage Munroe) & Abby (Paisley Cadorath) and an unremarkable office job.\nOne night, some thieves break into his house with a gun. Hutch prepares to fight but relents and lets them leave. Blake had one of the thieves in his grip, and Hutch had the perfect opportunity to attack, but he didn't. Instead, he asks Blake to let the thief go.\nEveryone sees Hutch as a failure, but Hutch reveals to his brother Harry that he held back because the burglars' gun was unloaded. Hutch and Harry speak over the radio hidden in Hutch's office.\nEddie Williams (Michael Ironside) is Hutch's father-in-law and his boss. Charlie (Billy MacLellan) is Eddie's son and Hutch's brother-in-law. He offers Hutch a gun for his own protection, which Hutch refuses. Hutch has given an offer to Eddie to buy out his business, but its not a great offer.It is revealed that Hutch used to work for the FBI.\nThe following evening, Hutch's daughter reveals that her bracelet is missing, and he sets out to find it. Hutch suspects the thieves from the previous night. He had seen the tattoo on one of thieves and finds the parlor where they got the tattoo. He finds their name and address. After tracking down the thieves, Hutch demands they return the bracelet, but he realizes they don't have it and leaves after seeing their sick baby drove them to crime.\nA group of thugs get on a bus Hutch is taking, and he brutally beats them. Hutch returns home and is bandaged by Becca. Becca knows Hutch's past.Unfortunately, one of his victims Teddy (Aleksandr Pal) is the brother of Yulian Kuznetsov (Aleksei Serebryakov), a Russian crime lord safeguarding the mob's Obshak (Common treasury money used to settle disputes) money, who sends a crew to Hutch's home. Yulian was able to track Hutch via his metro card, which he dropped on the bus.\nYulian bribes a pentagon official to find out Hutch's past. He instructs his staff to bring in Hutch alive.Harry calls Hutch ahead and warns him that the men he attacked were connected to Yulian. He asks Hutch to check with The Barber (Colin Salmon), Hutch's former Government handler.\nHutch hides his family, kills the attackers, and reveals he is a former \"auditor\"-an assassin employed by intelligence agencies.While employed as an auditor Hutch set a target free, who reformed and lived happily with a new family. Wanting a similar life, Hutch retired.\nHutch sends his family to safety and retrieves his hidden gold and cash, then finds the bracelet under the couch all along. He burns his house down to dispose of the dead assassins and steals his neighbors classic Dodge Challenger.Meanwhile, two assassins come to his father David's (Christopher Lloyd) retirement home and are swiftly taken out by the old man. Hutch uses the gold to buy his father in-law's metal fabrication factory and burns Yulian's Obshak money. He then proceeds to booby trap the entire factory.Hutch then visits Yulian and makes an offer to Yulian to end the fighting. Hutch says that Yulian attacked his family, and he burned down the Obshak. Yulian wants out as well as he cannot finance the entire Obshak. So, Hutch offers him a retirement in one of the lesser-known Caribbean Islands, away from the Russian mafia and Hutch will get his own life back.\nBut Yulian and his men pursue him to the factory and surround him. Suddenly his brother Harry (RZA) and father provide him with suppressing fire and the Russians are drawn into the factory.Using a variety of weapons and deadly traps that Hutch had prepared, Hutch kills them all. Harry and David survive the shootout, along with Hutch.Hutch is arrested but released with no charges filed thanks to a mysterious phone call. Three months later, while buying a new house with his wife, Hutch receives a call suggesting that his services are still required.",
