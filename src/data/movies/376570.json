    "A deaf and mute writer who retreated into the woods to live a solitary life must fight for her life in silence when a masked killer appears at her window.",
    "Maddie Young, a deaf-mute horror author, has decided to live alone in an isolated cottage in the woods, far from the commotion of the city. A terrifying mask-wearing attacker breaks into her haven, turning her calm existence into a nightmare. Maddie is unaware of how vulnerable she is due to her inability to hear or talk, which makes her the ideal victim for this persistent intruder. In a terrible struggle for her life as the tension mounts, Maddie is left to use her cunning and scant supplies to elude her unrelenting assailant. Her tenacity and creativity are put to the test on a heart-pounding basis at every turn.â€”frxzrgk"
