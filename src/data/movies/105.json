Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown.—Jwelch5742",
    "Hill Valley, California, 1985. Destined to follow in his wimpy dad's footsteps, average high school teenager Marty McFly is about to make history. And when his crackpot scientist friend Emmett \"Doc\" Brown fashions a time machine out of a 1982 DeLorean DMC-12, Marty inadvertently jumps back 30 years to do the unthinkable. But things were different in 1955. Like a fish out of water, Marty gives his all to keep the time/space continuum intact; however, unforeseen romantic complications stand in the way of a safe return. Now, a pressing question arises. What will it take to go back to the future?—Nick Riganas"
