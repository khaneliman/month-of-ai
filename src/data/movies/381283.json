    "A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.",
    "Amidst a wild flat meadow encircled by an Edenic lush forest, a couple have cocooned themselves in a secluded mansion that was not so long ago burned to the ground, devotedly restored by the supportive wife. Within this safe environment, the once famous middle-aged poet husband is desirous of creating his magnum opus; however, he seems unable to break out of the persistent creative rut that haunts him. Then, unexpectedly, a knock at the door, the sudden arrival of a cryptic late-night visitor and his intrusive wife will stimulate the writer's stagnant imagination. Little by little, much to the perplexed wife's surprise, the more chaos he lets in their haven, the better for his punctured male ego. In the end, will this incremental mess blemish, irreparably, the couple's inviolable sanctuary?—Nick Riganas",
    "In the burnt-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in a landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls. One day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study.",
    "A husband and wife, he old enough to be her father, have just moved into the isolated house that she has been renovating and continues to renovate to meticulous standards, it his house which was almost completely destroyed by fire. She does everything for him, including ensuring that his writing room, he a famous poet, is his sanctuary, especially important now as he has writer's block. Never feeling she is doing enough for him, she suffers from anxiety attacks, she self-medicating with an elixir whenever those attacks occur. One evening, they receive a knock on their door by a physician new to the area, he believing it a bed and breakfast. Regardless, the husband welcomes him in like he is an old and his best friend, which the wife cannot understand. It gets worse as the physician's wife then their two adult sons join them, the husband still welcoming them all to the confusion of the wife, especially as they are not the most accommodating of house guests. Concurrently, inexplicable things start to happen around the house about which only the wife notices and keeps to herself. Still loving her husband unconditionally, the wife has to figure out what's going on, especially why the husband seems so concerned about the welfare of others over her.—Huggo"

  "synopsis": "Note: the characters in this film are unnamed and are referred to by descriptors.The film opens with a woman standing in the midst of crackling flames. Her flesh burns to a crisp as screams are heard in the background.We then see a man, \"Him\" (Javier Bardem), place a crystal object in his bedroom. The house then changes from burnt and rundown to completely refurbished. A young woman, \"Mother\" (Jennifer Lawrence), materializes in his bed and seeing his absence she calls out for Him, \"Baby?\" He doesn't answer. Mother walks through the house which seems completely empty and as she steps out onto the porch to look him outside, he comes up from behind and startles her, hugging her.Him is a noted poet suffering from writer's block following the loss of his first wife. Mother is trying to paint one of the rooms in the house using different colors.
