    "Based on the story of Micky Ward, a fledgling boxer who tries to escape the shadow of his more famous but troubled older boxing brother and get his own shot at greatness.",
    "The Fighter is a drama about boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward's unlikely road to the world light welterweight title. His Rocky-like rise was shepherded by half-brother Dicky, a boxer-turned-trainer on the verge of being KO'd by drugs and crime.‚Äîanonymous",
    "Known as the \"Pride of Lowell (Massachusetts)\", Dicky Eklund Jr.'s primary claim to fame is his 1978 boxing match with Sugar Ray Leonard, where Eklund knocked down Leonard, who eventually won the match. In 1996, Eklund, now a crack addict, is in front of the cameras as an HBO film crew is making a documentary about him, the focus he believes (falsely) to be his boxing comeback at close to age 40. For the past ten years, he has also acted as one of the two trainers for his decade younger half brother, Micky Ward, who is known primarily as a brawler used by other boxers as a stepping stone to better boxers. Both their careers are managed by their domineering mother Alice Ward who believes it better to keep it all in the family. Because of his crack addiction, Dicky is unreliable. A move by Dicky and Alice at one of Micky's fights makes Micky come to the realization that his boxing career is being stalled and perhaps even under-minded by the two, who are only looking out for themselves. This stance is fostered by Micky's new girlfriend, college drop-out and now local bartender Charlene Fleming. As Micky tries boxing life without Dicky and Alice - much to their anger - he has to figure out where they fit into his life, especially as they do not get along with Charlene, if at all. These decisions become all the more important as Micky moves up the ranks and is given a shot at the world welterweight championship.‚ÄîHuggo",
    "In Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1993 former boxer Dicky Eklund, who once fought Sugar Ray Leonard, believes the TV crew are filming his come-back. In fact it is a documentary on 40 year old Eklund's descent into drug addiction. Younger half-brother Micky Ward is now the family's great white hope for a boxing world title but Dicky and mother Alice seem to think they have a stake in Micky. His girlfriend and father believe he should ditch them for a professional trainer and manager but when the crucial fights start to come Micky's way it's Dicky's advice that helps get him to the top, uniting all of them as Micky becomes world champion.‚Äîdon @ minifie-1",
    "Lowell, Massachusetts, 1993. Having once knocked the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard out, former boxer and self-destructive local hero Dicky Eklund is confident he's ready for his glorious comeback. But as a small HBO documentary crew shadows the substance-dependent has-been, his younger welterweight boxer step-brother, Micky Ward, treads water, forever trapped in career-damaging fights. However, with his faith in his manipulative mother/manager Alice faltering, Mickey gets one last chance at redeeming himself when feisty waitress Charlene Fleming offers him confidence and support to get back on track. And all the blood, sweat, and pain culminate in a make-or-break title fight against the undefeated British welterweight champion, Shea Neary. The question is, does Micky believe in himself to make it on his own?‚ÄîNick Riganas"
