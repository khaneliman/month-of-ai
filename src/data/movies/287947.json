His mother informs Billy he was intentionally abandoned on that day, and saw him with the police and that he would be better cared for by others since she was 17. Controlling his emotions in the face of the heartbreaking reality that his stubborn years-long search for his mother was for nothing, Billy quietly reassures his mother that he is fine, but he has to return to his real family. However, Billy gives his mother the key-chain compass she gave him years ago with a comment mixed with regret, resentment and understanding about her, \"You might need it more than me.\" Leaving, he receives a call and Sivana tells him to come home.
