    "When the evil spirit Pitch launches an assault on Earth, the Immortal Guardians team up to protect the innocence of children all around the world.",
    "When an evil spirit known as Pitch lays down the gauntlet to take over the world, the immortal Guardians must join forces for the first time to protect the hopes, beliefs, and imaginations of children all over the world.â€”DreamWorks Animation",
    "When the evil spirit Pitch Black, known by the children of the Earth as the Boogeyman, begins an attack, the Guardians - Santa Clause (North), The Toothfairy, The Easter Bunny, and the Sandman - must invite another new Guardian for help. When they attempt to add Jack Frost, he refuses out of spite that he isn't good enough. As the Guardians fight Pitch Black and convince Jack that he is good, the children slowly stop believing in them. Jack must help the Guardians restore their magic with the children of Earth so they can continue protecting the children from danger.",
    "The mysterious man in the moon chooses carefree and charming Jack Frost to be the next guardian. But he is reluctant until he is promised his memories back of a childhood he has long forgotten. A childhood as a human. Rising against him and the other guardians is Pitch Black, the bogey man who has long been forgotten. Now with his power of fear he will undo all the guardians stand for, above all the ability to believe in them",
    "Jack Frost awakens from a frozen pond with amnesia. Upon realizing no one can see or hear him, he disappears. Three hundred years later, Jack, as the young Spirit of Winter, enjoys delivering snow days to school kids, but resents that they do not believe in him. At the North Pole, the Man in the Moon warns Nicholas St. North that Pitch Black is threatening the children of the world with his nightmares. He calls E. Aster Bunnymund, Sandy, and Tooth, to arms. They are then told that Jack Frost has been chosen to be a new Guardian. Visiting Tooth's world, Jack learns that each and every baby tooth contains childhood memories of the children who lost it, Jack's teeth included. However, Pitch raids Tooth's home, kidnapping all of her subordinate tooth fairies except Baby Tooth and stealing all the teeth, thus preventing Tooth from sharing Jack's memories and weakening children's belief in Tooth. In order to thwart Pitch's plan, the group decides to collect children's teeth."

  "synopsis": "The spirit of winter, Jack Frost (Chris Pine), is lifted with no previous memory from the depths of a frozen pond by the Man in the Moon, only to discover that no one can see, hear, or touch him. Three-hundred years later, at the North Pole, Nicholas St. North, better known as Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), becomes aware that Pitch Black, the Boogeyman (Jude Law), has returned and is threatening the children of the world. After alerting fellow Guardians the Tooth Fairy/Toothiana (Tooth for short) (Isla Fisher), the Easter Bunny/E. Aster Bunnymund (Hugh Jackman), and the Sandman (Sandy for short) to the problem, North learns that Jack has been selected by the Man in the Moon as the new recruit. Jack, frustrated and hurt by centuries of isolation, declines the invitation, but North persuades him to cooperate by explaining their mission and the looming threat.Meanwhile, Pitch and his nightmare minions raid Tooth's palace, taking all the children's teeth and the memories stored within. He also captures Toothiana's helper fairies, but a single fairy, Baby Tooth, is rescued by Jack. Resentful that he himself is not believed in, Pitch plans to destroy children's faith in the Guardians and thereby weaken them by preventing Toothiana from doing her work. To avert this, the Guardians travel the world collecting teeth, promising Jack that when they find Pitch, they will help him regain his own baby teeth, and through them the memories of his past life. On the expedition, a young boy named Jamie Bennett (Dakota Goyo) is delighted to discover the Guardians in his room; he believes in all of them except for Jack, whom he cannot see. Pitch learns of the Guardians' resistance and attacks Jack and Sandy. Despite Jack's efforts to save him, Sandy is overwhelmed and seemingly killed by Pitch.The dejected Guardians rally by helping Bunnymund prepare his eggs for Easter. This is cause with the defeat of Sandman, the kids are already losing their faith & are being overwhelmed by nightmares & the next day is Easter & is one of quickest way to restore the kids faith.\nAlthough slightly complicated by the intrusion of Jamie's sister (who accidentally stepped into one of Santa's wormholes to emerge at the North Pole, while the Guardians were busy fighting Pitch), Sophie, the preparation goes smoothly.Jack takes Sophie home, but afterward a mysterious female voice lures him to Pitch's lair, where Tooth's fairies and the teeth are being held. Pitch keeps him distracted with the promise of his teeth's memories, while Jack's absence allows the nightmares to raid Bunnymund's domain, shattering all the eggs.After facing the disappointed Guardians, a despondent Jack departs in disgrace to Antarctica. There, Pitch tempts him to join forces, but Jack refuses, claiming that he does not want to be feared. In retaliation, Pitch threatens to kill Baby Tooth unless Jack relinquishes the source of his power, his staff. Pitch breaks the staff, and he throws both Jack and Baby Tooth down into an ice crevasse, where Baby Tooth convinces Jack to unlock his memories in an attempt to counter his despair. Long ago, his memories teach him, he was a mortal teenage boy who died saving his little sister from falling through the ice of the pond in which he awakened at the film's start.Because of that sacrifice, the Man in the Moon changed him into a spirit and chose him as a Guardian. Inspired by the revelation, Jack restores his staff and returns to help the Guardians.\nDue to the power of Pitch's nightmares, only one child (Jamie) still believes. Jack races to the boy first and strengthens Jamie's wavering faith in the Guardians, but by creating snow in Jamie's room, he causes the boy to believe that Jack Frost is real. Jamie is finally able to see him, much to Jack's delighted surprise. The weakened Guardians arrive to confront Pitch, while Jamie gathers his friends to support them. Pitch's seemingly overwhelming power proves no match against the children's faith, which allows the Guardians to battle the Boogeyman. Sandman is resurrected by this belief and joins the fight, leaving Pitch defeated, the children's faith restored, and Jack with believers of his own. Pitch is conquered by his own fear, and the nightmares drag him away into his lair.At this victory, Jack accepts his place as the Guardian of Fun and resolves to protect the world's children with his new friends.",
