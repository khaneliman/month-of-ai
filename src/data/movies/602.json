    "The aliens are coming and their goal is to invade and destroy Earth. Fighting superior technology, mankind's best weapon is the will to survive.",
    "On July 2nd, communications systems worldwide are sent into chaos by a strange atmospheric interference. It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species. After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere, David Levinson, an ex-scientist turned cable technician, discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles and Washington, as well as Paris, London, Houston and Moscow. The survivors set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. July 4th is their Independence Day...‚ÄîGustaf Molin <gumo@hem2.passagen.se>",
    "In the beginning of July, humans received a strange signal, and this has turned into a global phenomenon. A massive spaceshipwdd headed towards Earth and smaller spaceships began to cover entire cities around the world. Suddenly, the wonder turns into horror as the spaceships destroy the cities with energy desa. Then when the world counterattacked, the alien ships are invincible to military weapons. Then the President ofWda the United tStates decides to head to Area 51, to formulate a plan to defeat the aliens. Now the fate of the world rests on a handful of surviving humans.rd‚ÄîJohn Wiggins",
    "From the cold and pitch-black depths of the boundless space, a silent and insidious menace enters the solar system; grazes the Moon, and violates the Earth's atmosphere: an innumerable spaceship flotilla governed by a hostile and technologically advanced alien life form. As the extraterrestrial adversary's indestructible flying saucers wreak havoc on our planet from end to end killing millions, the end of the human race is near--and what is even more certain--we, the powerless and unprepared earthlings, are utterly defenceless. Once, we dreamed of making contact with otherworldly celestial entities. Now that the all-powerful invaders claim our world, the President of the United States and a handful of good men mad enough to stand up for all mankind must make a heroic last stand against the enemy, on a decisive Fourth of July. Will we survive to see another glorious Independence Day?‚ÄîNick Riganas",

  "synopsis": "On July 2, a giant alien mothership enters Earth orbit & spawns several smaller ships to cover the major cities on Earth.\nThe Mothership has a diameter of over 550 Kilometers and a mass roughly 1/4th of the moon. The smaller saucers are 24 Kilometers in diameter each.\nSETI site in New Mexico discovers a signal coming from the Mother ship. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) works in the TV media as a technical systems engineer. He discovers a countdown to destruction being relayed across Earth's satellites. Julius (Judd Hirsch) is David's old father and lives in New York.The military response is led by General William Grey (Robert Loggia), USMC, the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Albert Nimzicki (James Rebhorn) is the Secretary of Defense.\nAlbert advises President Whitmore to attack the alien ships, but Whitmore recommends going to Defcon 3 status instead until he knows more. As the saucers appear all over the world, they causing widespread panic, forcing Whitmore to evacuate his Government to a secure location, but he stays in Washington to assure the people.U.S. Marine Captain Steven Hiller and his unit, the Black Knights fighter squadron out of MCAS El Toro, are called back from fourth of July leave to defend Los Angeles; his girlfriend, Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox), decides to flee the city with her son, Dylan.\nHiller reports back to his unit to find that his application to NASA has been rejected.\nRetired combat pilot Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), now an alcoholic single father and crop duster, sees this as vindication of the alien abduction he has been claiming for 10 years.David takes Julius and his car and drives to Washington to try and warn Whitmore.\nWith the help of his ex-wife Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), a White House staffer, David warns President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) of the impending attack & they escape just in time. David and Julius accompany Thomas on Air Force One.\nThe saucers attack the respective cities simultaneously by discharging their primary weapon. The weapon unleashes a cascading wall of fire that travels through the city, destroying everything in its path.\nThomas's wife First Lady Marilyn (Mary McDonnell) was in LA at the time of the attack and was injured in the blasts, as her helicopter is damaged and crashed.\nMarilyn is found and rescued by Jasmine, who was also trapped in the city with Dylan.On July 3, the US attacks but their weapons fail to penetrate the craft's force field, and it responds by releasing scores of smaller \"attacker\" ships which are similarly shielded and armed with high-energy torpedoes. Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) manages to pursue one smaller ship & crashes it to capture the alien creature.As Hiller is dragging the alien across the desert, he is picked up by Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) who takes it to Area 51, commanded by Major Mitchell (Adam Baldwin). Area 51 is where the President and his plane have landed, after NORAD was hit in retaliatory strikes by the aliens.\nAlbert advocates for a nuclear strike on the alien ships. Albert knew about the existence of Area 51 and admits that the information was hidden from the President.\nArea 51 conceals a top-secret facility housing a repaired attacker ship and three dead alien bodies from the past. Attempts have been underway since the late 1960s to repair the attacker ship. Upon arrival of the alien Mother Ship, the controls for the attacker have become activated. Dr Okun (Brent Spiner) is the chief scientist of the facility.\nThomas asks David to work with Okun to try and figure out a way to defeat the alien technology. David figures out a way to connect with the computer on the alien attacker ship in Area 51.the alien captured by Steven, it awakens, telepathically invades Okun's mind and launches a psychic attack against Whitmore before being killed by Secret Service agents and military personnel. Whitmore reveals what he learned when they linked: the invaders' plan to annihilate Earth's inhabitants and harvest its natural resources, as they have already done to other planetary civilizations.\nThe rate at which the saucers are moving, they would destroy every major city on Earth in the next 36 hours.\nThe President decides to launch a nuclear attack, but the nuclear warheads also fail against the alien force field.Jasmine and Dylan commandeer a highway maintenance truck and rescue a handful of survivors, including the critically injured First Lady Marilyn Whitmore. Though Hiller rescues them in a helicopter that he borrows from the base, and takes them to Area 51, Marilyn's injuries are too severe, and she dies after reuniting with her family.David plans to use operable attacker ship to gain access to the interior of the alien mothership in space in order to introduce a computer virus that will disable the protective shields around the destroyers and attackers. David says that by destroying the mother ship, he will disorient the saucers, and buy a window of a few minutes during which a counterattack can be launched against the aliens. Albert is staunchly opposed to the idea, and Thomas fires him from his position.\nHiller volunteers to be pilot the attacker, with Levinson accompanying him to upload the virus. With satellite communications knocked out, the Americans have used Morse code to coordinate an attack with the remaining forces around the world, timed to occur when the invaders' shields are set to fail. President also volunteers along with Russell.Hiller and Levinson successfully reach the mothership and implant the virus. On the way they see preparations being made for a ground invasion.\nPresident Whitmore leads the American jet fighters against the alien destroyer that is approaching Area 51. Although the aliens now lack shields, the fighters' supply of missiles are quickly exhausted against the colossal craft and its large complement of assault ships.\nThe underside of the alien craft opens up as its directed energy weapon prepares to fire on the base. Russell possesses the last remaining missile, but his firing mechanism jams; he decides to pilot his aircraft into the alien weapon in a kamikaze attack. The explosion causes a chain reaction which annihilates the ship.Human resistance forces around the world use the same weak point to destroy the remainder of the alien ships, while the nuclear device planted by Hiller and Levinson destroys the alien mothership soon after the duo escape. Hiller and Levinson are caught up in the aftereffects of the mothership's explosion, but are able to return to earth unharmed, crash-landing the alien fighter in the desert close to Area 51.",
