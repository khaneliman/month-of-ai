    "A governess uses magic to rein in the behavior of seven ne'er-do-well children in her charge.",
    "1860s Victorian England. Sadly, the widowed undertaker, Cedric Brown, has a lot on his plate. As the desperate father works his fingers to the bone to provide for his seven unruly children, in the meantime, they have managed to drive out not one but seventeen nannies with their elaborate practical jokes and bad behaviour. Then, on a stormy night, the hideous government nanny extraordinaire, Nanny McPhee, sets foot in Cedric's household, bent on transforming the children's manners and the house. Will a dash of magic do the trick?—Nick Riganas",
    "In this dark and witty fable, Dame Emma Thompson portrays a person of unsettling appearance and magical powers who enters the household of recently widowed Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) and attempts to tame his seven exceedingly ill-behaved children. The children have managed to drive away seventeen previous nannies, but as Nanny McPhee (Thompson) takes control, they begin to notice that their vile behavior now leads swiftly and magically to rather startling consequences.—Daniel Cudley",
    "Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) is a sad and nostalgic widower, owner of an undertaker's business, who doesn't know how to manage the unsustainable situation with his undisciplined children. Every nanny (seventeen exactly) have run away from them. Simon (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), the oldest brother, is the head behind the pranks and he doesn't have a very good relationship with his father. But the solution will be Nanny McPhee (Dame Emma Thompson), a magic nanny who literally falls from heaven to discipline the children and teach them some lessons.—Alejandro Frias",
    "Based on the \"Nurse Matilda\" books by Christianna Brand comes the story of Nanny McPhee (Dame Emma Thompson). Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) is now a widower with seven ill-behaved children who've already chased away seventeen nannies. But when a mysterious voice tells Cedric to hire Nanny McPhee, she arrives at the Brown home and the kids learn to behave properly. But when great Aunt Adelaide (Dame Angela Lansbury) tells Cedric he must be married by the end of the month or she'll separate the children, he tries to find women, but the children run them off, and Nanny McPhee tells Simon, the eldest, that he will face the consequences, so the kids go to Selma quickly and admit what they did and ask to give their father a second chance and they will be married. Will the kids really find the perfect woman for their father?—Max Davison <RockyHexorcist2785>"

  "synopsis": "Widower Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) has seven children: Simon (Thomas Sangster), Tora (Eliza Bennett), Lily (Jennifer Rae Daykin), Eric (Raphaël Coleman), Sebastian (Samuel Honywood), Chrissy (Holly Gibbs), and baby Aggie (Hebe and Zinnia Barnes), all of whom he loves dearly, but spends little time with. The children have had a series of seventeen nannies, whom they drive out. They also terrorize the cook, Mrs. Blatherwick (Imelda Staunton) but are cared for and loved by Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) the young scullery maid.Cedric attempts to hire another nanny from the agency that sent the past seventeen nannies, but the agency refuses him, as the children have sent the past nannies away, terrorized. Desperate to find another nanny, Cedric heeds the advice of a mysterious voice from the house, which says, \"the person you need is Nanny McPhee.\" After a series of mysterious events, an unusual and hideous woman named Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) arrives at Brown home, introducing herself as a \"government nanny.\" She finds the children destroying the kitchen, and when they refuse to go to bed, she taps her magic staff, causing the children to uncontrollably demolish the kitchen. When Simon finally says \"please Nanny McPhee\", she magically clears up the mess and sends them up to bed. In similar fashions, with discipline and magic, she transforms the family's lives. In the process, she gradually becomes less hideous.The children have an elderly Great-Aunt, Lady Adelaide Stitch (Angela Lansbury). Though she believes that she is acting in concern for the well-being of her family, Aunt Adelaide is the source of major conflicts in the Browns' lives. In conjunction with her support for the family, Adelaide demands custody over one of the children in order to ensure their continued education and proper upbringing. Evangeline volunteers to go in the place of one of the children and Adelaide agrees, assuming that she is one of Cedric's daughters.Cedric decides to propose to a woman named Selma Quickly (Celia Imrie). Based on the image of stepmothers in fairy tales, the children assume that stepmothers are all cruel, and attempt to sabotage a visit from Mrs. Quickly. Mr. Brown's endeavors to protect Mrs. Quickly from his children's pranks result in him throwing himself on top of her, pulling her to the floor and burying his face in her cleavage. Nevertheless, Mrs. Quickly - ignorant of the children's pranks - is happy with all this provided that she gets a proposal. However, when his proposal is ruined by more pranks, she leaves and refuses to see him again. The children are thrilled that Mrs. Quickly is gone. However, Cedric reveals that his wages as an undertaker are insufficient to financially support his children and reveals that Aunt Adelaide had been financially supporting the Brown family for years with a monthly allowance, and that she would cut off the allowance if he did not remarry by the end of the month. If that happens, then Cedric will be thrown into debtors's prison and the children will be sent into the workhouse or adopted, due to them being thrown out due to being unable to pay the rent. Realising the only option, they confess to Mrs. Quickly that they were to blame for the disturbance of her visit, and lure her with promises of Aunt Adelaide's wealth.On the day of the wedding, the children discover that Mrs. Quickly is as conniving and cruel as they had feared when she breaks Aggie's rattle - a memento of their late mother. Evangeline returns as well, seemingly turned into a stoic and proper lady by Aunt Adelaide. When everyone is gathered for the wedding, Simon despairs that there is nothing more they can do to stop this marriage. Nanny McPhee advises Simon the best thing is to do \"exactly as you are told.\" Aggie begins repeating the word \"beehive\" (imitating Mrs. Quickly, as earlier she strictly told them to \"behave\") to Simon, who realizes the baby is telling him what to do. He and the other children disrupt the ceremony by pretending a swarm of bees has been attracted to Quickly's flowered hat. Cedric realizes that both he and his children truly dislike his wife-to-be, and joins in the disruption of the ceremony. Mrs. Quickly asks Cedric point blank if he can actually see any bees, and he says that yes, he can, then swats an imaginary bee from her hat so forcefully that she falls to the ground. Things soon lead to a riotous food fight, with Evangeline joining in. Angered, Mrs. Quickly puts an end to the wedding and storms off.Just as it seems that Adelaide's marriage deadline has passed without result, Simon realizes that his father could still marry Evangeline, to whom he has demonstrated something of an attraction, and the other way around. Although both Cedric and Evangeline attempt to deny it, due to the inevitable breaking of class boundaries such a marriage would cause, they finally admit their love for each other.Nanny McPhee taps her magic staff one last time, and provides a perfect backdrop for Cedric's marriage to Evangeline by creating a snowfall, covering over the ruined mess of the former ceremony. She also transforms Evangeline's dress into a wedding gown and Aggie's rattle is magically restored.Now that the children have learned all of Nanny McPhee's lessons, she has been transformed into a beautiful woman. As the wedding ceremony commences, Nanny McPhee is seen leaving in the final frames, with her voiceover reiterating her earlier declaration that \"When you need me, but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go.\"",
