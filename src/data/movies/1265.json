In class he bonds with cheeky newcomer Leslie Burke, whose writer parents moved into the neighboring house, despite her taking his only local prestige by beating him in a school race.

    "Jess Aarons comes from a poor farm family with four annoying sisters, and he finds no haven at school where he's teased by everyone. The only thing he has is running; after training all summer for the big race on the school athletic day, he and every other boy racing are beat by newcomer Leslie Burke. Like him, she is teased by her schoolmates, but unlike him she doesn't let it bother her. After a rocky start, they find common ground and together create the imaginary world of Terabithia as a haven from their struggles at school and home. Leslie teaches Jess to open his mind to every possibility and leave reality behind. But, after a tragedy occurs, he must trust in what she has taught him to help overcome the horrors that reality can bring.—O.G.",
