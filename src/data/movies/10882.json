    "After being snubbed by the royal family, a malevolent fairy places a curse on a princess which only a prince can break, along with the help of three good fairies.",
    "After the beautiful Princess Aurora is born into royalty, the entire kingdom gathers to celebrate, including three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Everything is perfectly fine until an uninvited guest appears, the evil fairy Maleficent. Maleficent curses the young princess by announcing that she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die before sunset on her 16th birthday. Fortunately, one of the good fairies, Merryweather, softens the curse so Aurora will not die, but only fall into a deep sleep instead, and the only way to wake her from her sleep is true love's kiss. Finally, the day comes.—Pat Conolly",
    "As the kingdom celebrates Princess Aurora's birth, a trio of friendly fairies bestows gifts upon the newborn. But the celebration is interrupted by the arrival of the villainous witch Maleficent, who curses Aurora to prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die before sunset on her 16th birthday. Disaster is averted when Merryweather softens the curse so instead of dying, Aurora will only sleep until true love's kiss awakens her. Desperate to keep Aurora safe from Maleficent's plot, the fairies adopt and raise her while living in a woodcutter's cottage in the forest. But on her 16th birthday, when Aurora (Briar Rose) falls in love with a mysterious stranger, the fairies realize that the stranger is her betrothed Prince Phillip. That evening, back at her parents' castle, Maleficent lures Aurora to prick her finger on the spinning wheel's spindle, and Aurora collapses into sleep. The fairies and Phillip must face Maleficent and a monstrous dragon if the prince is to break Maleficent's spell and bestow true love's kiss on the sleeping Aurora.—Blazer346",
    "Adaptation of the fairy tale of the same name. Princess Aurora is cursed by the evil witch Maleficent - who declares that before sunset on Aurora's 16th birthday, she will die from pricking her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle. To try to prevent this, the Three Good Fairies persuade the king to place her into hiding until the fateful day comes. Fortunately, thanks to Merryweather, Aurora did not die when she pricked her finger, but only slept until her true love, Prince Phillip, awakened her with a kiss.—Tim Pickett <quetzal@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>",
    "When a new princess is born to King Stefan and his queen, the entire kingdom rejoices. At a ceremony, three good fairies - Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather - bestow gifts of magic on the child. But an evil sorceress named Maleficent shows up, and because of a rude remark by Merryweather, she places a curse on the princess - named Aurora - that she will die before sunset on her 16th birthday when she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle. Thankfully, Merryweather turns things around by casting a spell so Aurora will not die, but only sleep and awaken to a kiss from her true love. The fairies take Aurora to a cottage in the woods to keep her away from the eyes of Maleficent, and raise her as their own child, named Briar Rose. On her 16th birthday, Aurora meets Prince Phillip, the son of a king whose own kingdom will soon merge with King Stefan's - and falls in love. Maleficent's horrible prophecy is fulfilled when she lures Aurora to prick her finger on the spindle, sending her into sleep, then Maleficent captures Prince Phillip. Realizing that the Prince is in trouble, the three good fairies head to Maleficent's castle at the Forbidden Mountain. But the Prince soon finds himself up against Maleficent's army of brutes, and the power of Maleficent's evil spells - which include a thorn forest and a fight against Maleficent when she turns herself into a dragon.—Derek O'Cain"

  "synopsis": "In Medieval France during the 14th century, King Stefan and Queen Leah have been blessed with the birth of a daughter, Princess Aurora. Many Ladies, Lords, and knights in shining armor all travel to pay their respects to the birth of the Princess. Also attending the event are King Hubert, another king of his neighboring kingdom, and his young son, Prince Phillip. Through an agreement between the two rulers, Phillip is betrothed to Aurora, and their marriage will unite the two kingdoms when they grow up.Also invited to the celebration are the Three Good Fairies: Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, as they're announced by the castle's chief steward of the household, Lord Duke. Flora says that each of them has come to bestow a gift on the Princess. She and Fauna gives the infant princess the gifts of beauty and song, respectively. But before Merryweather can bestow her gift, a gale of wind blows through the great hall, signifying the arrival of Maleficent, a witch from the Forbidden Mountain. Angry over not having been invited, Maleficent casts a spell, promising that before sunset on Aurora's 16th birthday, she'll prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die. A horrified Leah rushes to hold the baby in fright and an enraged Stefan orders his guards to arrest Maleficent, but she disappears with a laugh in a plume of smoke, leaving everyone horrified and worried about the princess's doomed future.Flora and Fauna persuade Merryweather to use her gift to weaken Maleficent's spell. Through her gift, Aurora wouldn't die from the prick of her finger, but only sleep until her true love awakens her with a kiss. Even so, Stefan is still fearful and orders every spinning wheel in the kingdom to be burned.The Three Fairies ponder what to do to prevent Maleficent's curse from taking effect. They then decide to hide their magic and disguise themselves as peasant women. The three then persuade the King and Queen that they will hide their daughter until she turns 16 and take her to an abandoned woodcutter's cottage.The years pass by, and as Aurora's 16th birthday approaches, the entire kingdom begins to rejoice. At the Forbidden Mountain, the atmosphere has stayed in a constant clouded thunder, a sign of Maleficent's mood and that her own quest to find the hidden princess has not been fulfilled. Maleficent's mood is also foul in that her minions have only been searching for a baby for the last 16 years, not realizing that Aurora would grow up. After punishing her minions, Maleficent sends her crow, Diablo, to find the princess.After 16 years, the princess has grown into a lovely young woman, whom the three fairies have renamed Briar Rose. On her 16th birthday, the three fairies (who've convinced the princess that they are her aunts) send her out to pick berries, while they prepare a birthday cake and dress for her. Briar Rose walks through the forest, confiding in some forest animals that follow her, that she dreams of one day meeting a handsome prince. Close by, some of the animals find a red cape, a hat, and some boots, and after taking their places, create a makeshift 'dream prince' for Briar Rose to dance with.However, it just so happens that these items belong to Prince Phillip, who has been riding through the forest on his horse, Samson. Before long, he hears Briar Rose singing, Phillip finds the princess, and the two share a dance, though neither knows that they are their betrothed. The princess is enchanted by the young man, but remembering how the fairies told her not to talk to strangers, runs away. However, she does tell the prince where she lives.Meanwhile, Merryweather and Flora argue about the color of Aurora's gown, with their magic attracting the attention to Diablo. Briar Rose returns to the cottage to find a dress and a cake made for her by the three fairies. Excitedly, she explains how she met someone in the forest, whom she is in love with. It is then that the fairies reveal who they really are, who Briar Rose really is, and that she is betrothed to Prince Phillip. When they explain that she must not meet this stranger again, Aurora runs to her room, distraught and crying. During all this, none of them have noticed that the same man Aurora met was her betrothal nor did they noticed Diablo peering through a window, before flying off to tell Maleficent about the update.Back at King Stefan's castle, King Hubert is also in attendance, as the entire court is preparing for Aurora to return. With the castle's court composer, Sir Minstrel, getting drunk, Stefan and Hubert speak grandly of the future for their children until Prince Phillip arrives and grandly tells his father about the peasant girl he met in the woods that he hopes to marry. Hubert is upset at this turn of events and tries to persuade him to remember his betrothal, but Phillip rides back to the forest and to the cottage, leaving Hubert glum about how he will tell Stefan about what Phillip says.At the same time, the Three Fairies have brought Aurora back to the castle through a secret entrance, to prepare her to meet her family. However, she is still upset about never seeing the young man in the woods again. They give her some time to herself, but in their absence, a secret passage magically opens in the castle room, and a green orb appears. Aurora, under a trance, follows the orb through the passageway.When the Three Fairies enter the room, they are horrified to see Aurora following the orb and give a chase after her. At the top of one of the towers, the orb changes into a glowing spinning wheel. The fairies call for Aurora not to touch anything, but Maleficent's voice lures Aurora to prick her finger on the spinning wheel's spindle. As a result, Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna arrive too late to save Aurora and gasped as Maleficent reveals her true self. She taunts her rivals of their failure to stop her by revealing the now sleeping Aurora and vanishes, cackling wickedly at her rivals' failure to stop her and save Aurora.Outside in the castle courtyard, an announcement was inadvertently proclaimed, informing everyone to welcome the princess home. However, in the castle's highest tower room, the sad three fairies have placed Aurora on a bed, still distraught over their failed attempt to stop Maleficent and save Aurora. As Merryweather and Fauna wonder how they'll explain the incident to Aurora's parents, Flora decides to put the entire kingdom to sleep until Aurora is awakened. Using their magic, they cast a powerful sleeping spell all over everyone in the kingdom, including King Stefan, King Hubert, Queen Leah, Sir Minstrel, and Lord Duke. While putting Stefan, Leah, and Hubert asleep in the throne room, Flora hears Hubert talking to Stefan about Phillip meeting a peasant girl. Deducing that it was Phillip that Aurora had met in the forest, they remember her saying how the person she met would be coming to the woodcutter's cottage. Flora told Merryweather and Fauna that they must return to the cottage. Hoping to get to him and save the whole kingdom from their eternal slumber, the fairies set off through the forest, only to find the cottage door wide open and Phillip's hat on the floor. The three fairies deduce that Maleficent and her henchmen have already captured him and determined to go to the Forbidden Mountain in order to rescue him, so he can have the chance to rescue Aurora, King Stefan, King Hubert, Queen Leah, and every other residents in the kingdom from their eternal slumber.Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather sneak into the castle, where they find Maleficent's goons celebrating, while she pays a visit to Phillip, who is imprisoned in a dungeon. Maleficent taunts Phillip with an image of Aurora sleeping, and of one day sending him off to wake the princess, once he and his horse Samson have aged considerably, laughing cruelly at the very idea.Once she leaves, the Good Fairies free Phillip and arm him with the Shield of Virtue and the Sword of Truth. With his new weapons and the fairies' held and while Flora turns the goons' weapons into harmless entities, Phillip finds Samson and they ride off toward King Stefan's castle. Diablo tries to warn Maleficent, but Merryweather turns him into a petrified stone before returning to Phillip, Flora, and Fauna.Horrified at Diablo's petrification and enraged at the sight of Phillip heading to Stefan's castle, Maleficent tries to strike down Phillip with lightning bolts, but the Shield of Virtue deflects them. Before he can reach the castle, her dark magic creates a forest of thorns that surrounds the structure. Phillip triumphs and cuts his way through with the Sword of Truth. Outraged at his determination, Maleficent teleports herself through the French countryside to Stefan's castle and appears before Phillip, blocking his path. In order to stop him from breaking her curse on Aurora and save her and the whole kingdom, Maleficent transformed herself into an enormous, fire-breathing dragon. At first, he appears to be no match for the enormous dragon, but with the help of the three fairies, he hurls the Sword of Truth into Maleficent's heart, causing her to fall to her demise.With Maleficent finally vanquished for good, the fairies lead Phillip to the sleeping Aurora's bedside, where he placed a kiss on her, awakening her and also allowing King Stefan, King Hubert, Queen Leah, and everyone else in the kingdom to wake up from their eternal slumber. After Hubert, Stefan, and Leah awaken, the sound of the trumpets heralds the arrival of Aurora and Phillip and it is soon made clear to Hubert that it was actually Aurora that Phillip met in the woods. The two then share a dance as their parents and the three fairies watch. However, Merryweather and Flora continue fighting over the color of Aurora's gown again as the dancing couple lived happily ever after.",
