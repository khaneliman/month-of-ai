Kim lives with her mother Lenore and her wealthy stepfather Stuart. Kim manages to convince her reluctant father to allow her to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda. When the girls arrive in Paris they share a cab with a stranger named Peter, and Amanda lets it slip that they are alone in Paris. Using this information an Albanian gang of human traffickers kidnaps the girls. Kim barely has time to call her father and give him information. Her father gets to speak briefly to one of the kidnappers and he promises to kill the kidnappers if they do not let his daughter go free. The kidnapper wishes him \"good luck,\" so Bryan Mills travels to Paris to search for his daughter and her friend.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
    "After reluctantly agreeing to let his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), go to France with her best friend, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is horrified to hear that she is kidnapped by an Albanian gang whose specialty is prostitution rings. With only 96 hours to go before he'll never find her again, Bryan rushes to France to save her. As a former CIA agent, he has all the skills necessary to rescue her - if he can only find her.—The Mariah",

His ex-wife Lenore and her new husband Stuart are all for it and Kim sets off with a friend. On arrival in Paris however, Kim and her friend are kidnapped by mobsters running a slavery-prostitution ring. Bryan's only lead is a short snippet of a conversation from when Kim phoned him in a panic. With that, he's able to identify the origin of the speaker and which criminal gang he's with. Once in Paris, he quickly shows everyone connected with the case that he will stop at nothing to get his daughter back.—garykmcd",

However, when Mills reluctantly gives his permission to let Kim and her friend, Amanda, travel to Paris, his fears will be justified, as the two innocent girls get kidnapped on arrival by a ruthless white-slavery ring. Now, up against the well-prepared kidnappers, the seasoned veteran has less than 96 hours to rescue his daughter, and the clock is ticking. Can Mills put the fragments of information to good use?—Nick Riganas"
