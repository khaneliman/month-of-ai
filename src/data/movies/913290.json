    "A woman staying at an Airbnb discovers that the house she has rented is not what it seems.",
    "In town for a job interview, a young woman arrives at her Airbnb rental late at night only to find that the house has been mistakenly double-booked and a strange man is already staying there. Against her better judgment, she decides to stay the night anyway, but soon discovers that there is much more to be afraid of in the house than the other house guest.",
    "Brightmoor, Detroit. On a chilly night pouring with rain, young Tess drives into the unknown, ill-lit neighbourhood and parks outside her Airbnb on 476 Barbary Street. Now, more than anything, Tess wants to hit the sack--after all, she has a busy day tomorrow. Instead, unsuspecting Tess is in for a shock when she realises the letting agent has double-booked the house. And as mysterious Keith tries to understand, doing his best to break the ice and right the wrong, Tess is about to discover that there are a million reasons to be afraid of the dark.—Nick Riganas"
