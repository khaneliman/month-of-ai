  "synopsis": "The justice league calls constantine and zatanna to go to a ship, at the ship all the teams including justice league and teen titans discuss about raiding apokolips to stop darkseid, they do indeed do it but get ambushed leaving most of the members in a bloody matter. 2 years later Constantine is drinking beer with Etrigan in a bar because he left his wife get killed by the paradooms, Superman gets blamed for letting most of the justice league members getting killed ( who is now powerless because of liquid kryptonite being injected into him and now has a green tattoo of his symbol ) he and Raven ( who is struggling to maintain her father's imprisonment ) come in and want to find Damian, Raven teleports them to Damian. Damian ( who's now 17 ) is at the league of assassins' headquarters, he explains that most of the teen titans got killed including Dick ( who got resurrected by the lazarus pit but became insane ), they both go to strykers land were Lois Lane ( who is now part of the suicide squad ) and a bunch of villain's hang out, she and Harley Quinn are fighting she ends up winning, the heroes and villains make weapons ( their weapons have kryptonite incorporated in them ), both teams infiltrate lexcorp tower to use bottoms ( located in the building ) to teleport to apokolips, in lexcorp some of the villains kill the paradooms but get killed in the process and the surviving heroes encounter Lex Luthor who reveals he was a mole working with Lois to gain intel on Darkseid, from there the group decides to split Raven, Constantine, Damian, superman and etrigan go to apokolips the other group at the remaining building to defend the boom tube, batman ( who is now mind by darkseid ) informs darkseid about Luthor's betrayal so batman decides to send paradooms the newly converted mechanical Furies at the heroes. Entering apokolips Superman's group is attacked by the furies consisting of most of the heroes that died ( who are now half human and are working for darkseid ), Etrigans gets killed by Wonder Woman, but Constantine manages to break her free using her Lasso of Truth, this makes half robot wonder woman good again and decides to attack the furies as the group goes inside the building, inside they encounter Flash who is now running on a treadmill powering apokolips, Constantine now learns that Flash had altered the timeline in the past ( depicted in flashpoint paradox ) he ends up stopping Flash, and in the room they see Cyborg who is now integrated in the planets network, Constantine breaks Cyborg free of his mind control done by darkseid, witch also frees the furies as well right as they are about to overpower Wonder Woman. Batman and Darkseid return. Darkseid orders Batman to kill Damian but he hesitates when he is reminded of his parents' death ( by damian ), which breaks him free of Darkseid's mind control. In a fit of rage Darkseid tries to kill Batman but his attack is intercepted by Damian, who dies in Batman's arms, Raven is overwhelmed by his death, her sadness sets trigon free from her gem ( it gives her a white version of her cloak, implying that she no longer has inner demons inside of her ), Constantine offers his body as a vessel for Trigon but he refuses, he snaps his neck and takes Clark's body instead, they infuse which causes purging the kryptonite from his body, restoring his powers, he attacks Darkseid, constantine is briefly visited by Zatanna in the afterlife who reveals she used a spell to manipulate Constantine to flee back to Earth as part of a contingency plan prepared by Batman if the league fails they share a kiss before he gets revived. Simultaneously, Raven and Zatanna revive Damian and Constantine. Back at lexcorp Lois's team is surrounded by paradooms, prompting them to explode the building resulting in all of the heroes and villains deaths , Lois sends a goodbye video to apokolips with Cyborgs assistance to Superman, her death triggers Superman which frees him from Trigon ( he gets his original superman appearance ) trigon is back to normal so that he can continue fighting. Cyborg then reveals his plan to teleport the Paradooms back to Apokolips while dragging the planet into a boom tube with no exit. Cyborg then teleports the surviving heroes back to earth, and commences his plan. Relishing the battle, Trigon prevents Darkseid's escape as they are dragged into oblivion( which is a black void ). Back at earth ( their in front of the titans tower ) despite their victory half of the world's population got killed, Batman explains that one-third of Earth's magma has been drained by the Reapers, the planet's rotation being compromised meaning that millions upon millions of people could die before they can find a solution so Constantine convinces the Flash to create another flashpoint ( it resets the timeline and creates a new universe ) Damian and Raven kiss ( both sitting on a boulder ) as the rest of the heroes watch as the timeline gets reseted as a bright light covers the world, leaving their ultimate fates unknown. ( it's unknown if they ended up dying or staying alive )",
