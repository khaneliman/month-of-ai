  "synopsis": "Dressed in a flamboyant devil's outfit, Elton John (Taron Egerton) enters an addiction rehabilitation session, and begins to recount his life in a flashback (The B**ch Is Back).\nYoung Elton (born Reginald Dwight) grows up in 1950s England, raised by his cold, non-affectionate mother Sheila (Bryce Dallas Howard) and more loving grandmother Ivy (Gemma Jones). His father Stanley (Steven Mackintosh) is mostly absent from the home due to service in the Royal Air Force. Reginald shows interest in playing the piano and displays the ability to \"play by ear\" - instantly playing music perfectly on the piano after listening to it once. He hopes to perform for his father on his return, but Stanley takes no interest in his son or his talent for music (I Want Love).Reginald then begins formal training with Ivy's support, eventually leading to study at the Royal Academy of Music.\nStanley eventually abandons his family after Sheila has an affair with another man. Later, Reginald develops an interest in rock music artists such as Elvis Presley and begins performing in local pubs (Saturday Night's Alright).
